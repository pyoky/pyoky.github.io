            <h1>Evaluation of Optimization Algorithms  for Machine Learning Applications</h1>

            <p>ABSTRACT - Recent advances in the field of machine learning has profoundly impacted the way we interact with the world. These advances are driven by the discovery of the back-propagation algorithm used to train various types of neural networks—the key to its success, determined by the mathematical optimization algorithm used for minimizing its cost function. In this paper, I discuss the design of neural networks and the methods used for its training, and evaluate the different optimization algorithms used to train a neural network.
