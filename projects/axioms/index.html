            <h1>Implementation of Common Axiom Systems and Proof Generation</h1>

            <p>
                Utilizing the function FindEquationalProof introduced in version 11.3 of Mathematica, I implemented and proved common algebraic and logical conjectures as well as hypothetical, but plausible combinations of axioms and conjectures, as introduced in Chapter 12, Section 9 of Stephen Wolfram's book, A New Kind of Science.
