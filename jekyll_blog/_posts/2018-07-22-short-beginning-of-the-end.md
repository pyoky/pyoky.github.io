Each experience in life can be lamented as a the single, unique, “one-time” experience—each moment, therefore is simultaneously a gift and a curse: a unique and exciting gift, but also a curse, due to the irreversibility, the irrevocability of the event.

Then, regret becomes, on some level, the boundary between these two sides: the more things you consider part of a general whole, the less regret you have, but the less preciseness you feel. The fact that *“The sun will rise tomorrow”* instills hope and therefore implies a lack of regret, but as a consequence each day is stripped of its significance. On the other hand if one was to obsess on the unique weather of each day, then they would be astonished and amazed every day simply staring up at the sky, but would be full of disappointment that it will soon be gone.

A common Japanese phrase: *“when you start hoping for this moment thing to last, it is the beginning of the end.”*
