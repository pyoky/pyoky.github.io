This is an extract from the rational of my research on the Enigma Machine.

Encryption is a crucial part in our lives in this age of information. For all practical purposes, however, encryption may seem to be unneeded; Assuming everybody is well-purposed and are “nice” people, there is no reason to hide information. However, by nature humans desire privacy, and that desire is one of the fundamental principles of our complicated modern society. Whether it is to keep military secrets, or to hide your embarrassing texts with your ex-boyfriend, encryption , I believe, represents a technology solely developed for humans. Our craving for privacy and secrecy is what defines our unique identity, and encryption is what enables us to do so in the digital world.
Another significant fact about the Engima machine is that it was defeated. The fact that the first encryption device, thought to be unbreakable, was broken, reveals how every encryption method is capable of being exploited, and the designer should always keep that fact in mind. Modern encryption methods, however complicated, is theoretically breakable; the currently widely-used RSA algorithms can be defeated using a quantum algorithm; and there have already been advances in replacement technologies for when quantum computing would become mainstream. This shows the basic incompleteness of encryption, and that there is no “perfect” method, only a better one.
By understanding the mathematics behind the Enigma and the Bombe, I believe I would gain a better understanding of the fundamental ideas behind encryption; how, but more importantly, why, we design encryption.
