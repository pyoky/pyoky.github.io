The journey to productivity is more often motivated by need than interest, as, one would arguably assume, *work is nobody’s favorite subject.* Yet, I find such systems deeply interesting, often diving deeper than what would be practical. The beginning of this journey was, even for me, out of necessity—but gradually I gained an admiration of this art of *self-discipline*, as I often do with this kind of topic. I hope to reveal my personal reason for this choice, and outline a few techniques that I actually implement, hoping that it might help anybody who needs it.

My reasoning for wasting time on unnecessarily deep investigations on increasing efficiency (like this essay) is to maximize *future freedom*. My studies should not prevent me from occasionally wanting to stay in bed until noon, or spontaneously taking a long walk on a weekday evening. Discipline, therefore, would be equivalent to buying time for your future self; a way of allowing them to focus on what they *want*, rather than what I want. I sometimes imagine a device that can saving and restore time at will—one might save an hour of commute time and be unconscious during that interval, and later use it when necessary, stopping the world around them. Being productive is the closest to this fantasy, as the problem of time management is procrastination, not a lack of time.

If we were to suppose a device to control time, it it might also be practical to imagine that similar technologies would have freed us from labor. In an ideal world, nobody would be required to work. Despite notions that work allows us to “contribute to society,” or "give back what you got,” actuallly meaningful contributions to our world is driven not by financial need like work, but rather by passion. People who find meaning in creating, artists, musicians, developers, would continue to create regardless of whether they get something in return or not. Most current jobs can and will be automated in the near future, and are far from contributions, closer to maintenance. Critical roles in our current world—government officials, financial institutions—are simply jobs that lubricate the gears that turn the wheels of society, and despite the importance and indispensability of such work in contemporary society, they do not offer true advancements to our race. Most contemporary work is subject to simple or complex physical mechanization, and as intellectual automation gets affordable and reliable, most jobs—including those that are crucial in our current understanding of society—would become meaningless. Mental and physical freedom from labor is, therefore, the ultimate goal of increasing productivity. The end goal isn’t to balance work, but rather to remove it.<sup>[[1]](#1)</sup>

What is meaningful work? This closely relates to my interpretation of freedom—when one is free to do whatever they want, then some small portion would choose to create. Creativity in not only the arts, but in all academic disciplines, increasing the database of human knowledge, and trying to make sense of our world.

I will skip discussions of such an ideal world, though, to return to more practical advice. The key to efficiency is to reducing the overhead in every task. This includes automating repetitive and dull tasks if possible (easier in computational tasks than physical ones), e.g. stockpiling supplies or scripting workflows. Simplicity is crucial in maintaining efficiency, as our minds are not well-equipped for complexity greater than a certain threshold. This is not to be confused with visual complexity—a clean room can be efficient, but a dirty room in which its owner can easily locate everything is equally economical. If something, whether it be an idea, project, or an object, is unnecessary, throw it out. If it isn’t, organize it in within your own system.

Organization systems can be a bit more flexible, as knowing what works for you is more important than following certain principle. I personally use a system called Getting Things Done<sup>[[3]](#3)</sup>, outlined in the book. The program I use to impliment this is called Omnifocus, in which I collect any ideas or due tasks, which are then formatted and organized into subsections *called* Projects. Other features are minor conveniences, but the crucial part of any program, or even a paper-based system is the ability to capture every drifting idea, and then to organize and display them when needed. For example, if I were to think of a topic for a blog post, the task manager would be responsible for recording what I tell it about my thought, organizing it into the right projects (giving enough information), and displaying it when I sit down to write. This process is rather a popular one, and is outlined in a short and informative video from CrashCourse.

One must, however, be aware of the time cost for managing this system, relative to the cost of actually executing each task. This problem is a common and well documented occurrence<sup>[[4]](#4)</sup>. Another trap that can be more subtle, but equally dangerous, is that of endless self-improvement. That is, internalizing barriers in tasks, rather than identifying and addressing an external issue. An article about a more generalized version of this problem can be found in the link<sup>[[5]](#5)</sup>.

Increasing productivity can be a rewarding and interesting experience, given that one avoids the common pitfalls and misconceptions. I am still in the midst of altering my system or organization, and I do not see my journey ending quite soon yet, if ever.

The following is an additional list of minor but helpful mental models:
- If a task costs less than a threshold (e.g. 5 minutes), do it immediately
- A self-aware disciplinary task accomplished first in the morning effectively increases motivation for the rest of the day
