In response to a Q&A session with Stephen Wolfram after my summer camp, I found a particular one of his answers interesting. The question he was asked was about his personal reconciliation of the discrepancies; the academic “purity” of his work—contemplating on the extents of physics, while also running a multi-national, for-profit firm.

The answer was: he doesn’t. The interesting part, though, was how he described the interaction between these two categories—foundational and applied—as “air support,” as concepts devised in one are applicable on the other. This pragmatic view aligned with how I naturally seemed to perceive my own problems as well—practicing math often gives insight into social problems, algorithms for solving purely academic problems apply to real-world ones, and trivial gossip at school can leave deep insight into some interesting branches of thought.

What does this imply? The principle of emergence—or as Stephen Wolfram would describe it, computational equivalence—dictates the arising complexity of applied fields. But the more fundamental subjects are abstracted far beyond what these simple connections would imply—how this “air support” apparently works. I hope to talk about this in a later post.
