Not many of my fellow classmates understand when I say that one of my favorite hobbies is studying—they know why it’s important, but not how to enjoy it. They often seem to have better things to do, than to sit around and work all day. In their eyes, me, enjoying schoolwork—not just a single subject, but work itself—is an abnormality.

A necessary detail is that my school is not subject to most problems plaguing many high schools—our teachers are passionate, insightful, and never decline a request for help. There are no serious social issues, and especially since the school is so small, everyone is part of a tightly-knit group. So some of my observation and experiences might be limited to my own school, and I do not deny that many of these insights are only obtainable in a well-maintained education system. But I still do argue that this is how one should approach learning, regardless of their environment.

One should not consider studying as work per se. In my “Why Be Productive” essay, I discussed the subtle distinctions between contribution and maintenance. Studying, at a high school level, is preparation for such contribution. You are given, through education, the building blocks with which you can create and contribute.

This may be why many might indeed feel that what they are learning is “useless.” Maintenance does not require abstract or critical thinking skills—a part-time cashier will benefit nothing from their calculus class, as well as most white-collar workers. The real meaning of studying these subjects are in that they provide the ingredients for thinking—an insight into a particular school of thought. Such flexible thinking is required in almost all but the most physical labor—which are now mostly automated.

From a more idealistic point of view, these ingredients will work to contribute, and the goal of higher level education would be to push the human race forward, in the hopes that everyone capable would be creating and advancing civilization each moment. Like the term “Liberal Arts” that imply the necessity of education, in that one is imprisoned by the lack of knowledge, education, ideally, is the necessary process that puts everyone at the level in which they have the choice to create, whether they take the path or not. It would be immoral not to.

On a personal level, though, studying is unavoidable to fair well in life. Especially in my culture, good grades do decide a major portion of life—even as much as luck. I cannot deny such a fear is also a subconscious motivation for me “liking” studying—but I do try to enjoy it as much as possible. A major personal paradigm shift in my viewpoint was when I took advanced physics courses during the end of 8th grade. Learning up to a point where you are told that this is the forefront of this subject—and especially when that subject is one that aims to describe how this universe operates, shows, first, that there are no insurmountable mountains of knowledge, that there is an end to every subject; and second, a picture of myself advancing into the further uncharted territories. Confidence, and curiosity, is what I learned.

With this paradigm, each subject reveals its own appeal. Physics gives you the foundations for your world view (one potential, fundamental truth), and states that all you and everything else in the universe are, are twelve particles interacting in specific ways. Chemistry describes how these particles come together to form an atom, and again how they come together to interact in interesting ways. Biology, leading somewhat to our own bias towards ourselves, specializes in how these interactions make up living things, while Neuroscience further specializes in the brain. Psychology describes how a brain might behave, and Sociology describes how a bunch of brains can come together to form patterns and regulations in behavior. Economics, or Political science has an additional layer of artificial separation—capitalism, and democracy, communism, etc.—whose ideas we actually live in.<sup>[[1]](#1)</sup>

Most students, I believe, may stand on the top of this mountainous stack, but have no knowledge of what they stand upon. I still do not understand each piece of this mountain that I am standing on, and nobody will ever. However, what I do know is the system with which this monument of human knowledge is built upon, the protocols in which new blocks are added, and a vague grasp of each major structural part. This is what makes studying interesting for me.
