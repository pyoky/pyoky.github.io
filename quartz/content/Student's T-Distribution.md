def. Studentâ€™s T Distribution.

$$
t_{n-1}\sim \frac{\sum_{i=0}^n (\bar{X_n}-\mu)^2}{\hat{\sigma}/\sqrt{n}}
$$

where:

- $X_i\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^2)$
- $\hat{\sigma}$ is the [[Besset Correction|Besset-corrected]] standard deviation estimator

> [!hint]
> It's called a **Student**'s t because it was from a beer brewery company, and the company didn't want the in-house statistician to publish it so he published it secretly.
