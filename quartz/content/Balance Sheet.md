Items on a balance sheet:

- **Cash & Equivalents:** highly liquid assets on hand by a firm
- **Recieveables & Payables**: unofficial debts, e.g., regular grocery purchases, etc.
- **Inventories**: Items not sold
- **Property, Plant, & Equipment (PP&E)**, i.e. Durable capital assdets
- **Stockholder’s Equity**: money recieved by purchasers of stock

**Properties**.
- Assets and liabilities must always sum to zero.
- counts book value, _not_ market value ⇒ hard to measure the “value” of a firm
- soft skills (e.g. brand image, reputation) are not reflected (the market may better reflect intangibles).
