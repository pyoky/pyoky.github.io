## Problem 2

```python
function VC(v)
	# including v
	in = 1
	for child c of v:
		in += min(c.in, c.ex)
	
	# not including v
	ex = 0
	for child c of v:
		ex += c.in
		
	v.in = in
	v.ex = ex
	
	return min(v.in, v.ex)
```

- Base case: for a leaf node `leaf`, `leaf.in = 1, leaf.ex = 0`
- IH: for node `v` with leaves `u1..uk`, assume `ui.in, ui.ex` is correct
- IS: for node `v`,
	- Case including: `VC` including `v` does not require `u1..uk` to be included, but including it may be more minimal. IH guarantees `ui.in, ui.ex` is correct so take the minimum
	- Case excluding: `VC` excluding `v` requires all of `u1..uk` to be included, so in that case sum all the `ui.in` values to guarantee counting all cases where children are included
- Time complexity: $T(n)\leq \text{\#children}\cdot T\left(\frac{n}{\text{\#children}} \right)+O(1)={\color{red}O(n)}$

## Problem 3

```python
def PalindromeDecomposition

	# memo[n][n] is a 2-d array whose value is all "N"
	
	# in increasing order of gap
	for gap=1..n
		for i=0..n-gap-1
			j = i + gap
			
			# base case
			if i==j
				memo[i][j] = Y
				continue
				
			# if edges are same, check the inner
			if A[i] == A[j]
				if memo[i+1][j-1] == Y
					memo[i][j] == Y
				else
					memo[i][j] == N
					
			# if edges are diff, not palindrome
			else A[i] != A[j]
				memo[i][j] == N
	
	# memo_count[n][n] is a 2-d array whose value is all 0.
	
	# in increasing order of gap
	for gap=1..n
		for i=0..n-gap-1
			j = i + gap
			
			# if the whole length i-j is palindrome, 1
			if memo[i][j] == Y
				memo_count[i][j] = 1
				
			# if the whole length isn't palindromic...
			minPcount = +infty
			for k=0..j-i:
				# get the minimum palindrome split of all possible splits
				min(minPcount, memo[i][i+k-1] + memo[i+k][j])
			memo_count[i][j] = minPcount
	
	return memo_count[0][n]

```

- Part 1:
	- Base case: a length-1 string is a palindrome
	- IH1: substring $A[i+1][j-1]$ is a palindrome
		- IS1: then if $A[i]=A[j]$, the string $A[i][j]$ is a palindrome
	- IH2: substring $A[i+1][j-1]$ is not a palindrome
		- IS2: then the string $A[i][j]$ cannot be a palindrome
- Part 2:
	- Base case: If the string $A[i][j]$ is a palindrome, then it is the minimum palindromic split of count 1
	- IH: palindromic substring count has been computed correctly from all proper substrings of $A[i][j]$
	- IS: the minimum palindromic substring if $A[i][j]$ is the minimum of the sums $A[i][i+k-1]+A[i+k][j]$ for $k \in [i,j]$
- Thus proved

- Part 1 span: $O(n^2)$ as filling a 2-d array with $O(1)$ calculation per subarray
- Part 2 span: $O(n^3)$ as filling a 2-d array with $O(n)$ calculation per subarray
- â‡’ Total time complexity: ${\color{red}O(n^3)}$
