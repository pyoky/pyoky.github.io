$$
\begin{align}
\epsilon_{D}&\coloneqq\frac{\%\Delta x}{\% \Delta p} \\
&=\frac{\frac{\Delta x}{x}}{\frac{\Delta p}{p}}=\frac{p}{x} \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta p} \\
&\to \frac{p}{x}\frac{dx}{dp}=\frac{d\ln x}{d\ln p}
\end{align}
$$

- Elasticity can be:
	- $|\epsilon_{D}|>1$…Elastic
	- $|\epsilon_{D}|=1$…Unit Elastic
	- $|\epsilon_{D}|<1$…Inelastic
	- Reminder that elasticity is almost always negative (for a downward-sloping demand curve (=ordinary good))
- Elasticity of demand can vary along a single demand curve
	- There is an "elastic portion" and "inelastic portion"
	- Elasticity determines if a firm should produce more or less to increase revenue. ![[Pasted image 20231105105537.png]]
