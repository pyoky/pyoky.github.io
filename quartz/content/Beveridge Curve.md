![Untitled](Untitled%2015.png)

- It may shift due to: increased in unemployment benefits, participation rate changes, etc.
  [Beveridge curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beveridge_curve)

  > The curve, named afterÂ [William Beveridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Beveridge "William Beveridge"), is **hyperbolic-shaped** and **slopes downward**, as a higher rate of unemployment normally occurs with a lower rate of vacancies.

- The more inwards, the more efficient the labor market is.
  - i.e. the matchmaking between employer and employee is done well.
