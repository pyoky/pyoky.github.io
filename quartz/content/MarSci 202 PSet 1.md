### 1. Scatterplots with Regression Lines, Equations, R², and P-values

For the Kelp regression, the equation is:
$$
\text{Biomass} = -169.33 + 100.72 \times \text{Length}
$$
- **R² value**: 0.9432
- **p-value**: 1.79e-09 (for length parameter estim.)
For the Whale regression, the equation is:
$$
\text{Biomass} = -2858 + 1098 \times \text{Length}
$$
- **R² value**: 0.8439
- **p-value**: 1.34e-06 (for length parameter estim.)

1  34.20         3275.1112
2  19.80         1824.8209
3  15.40         1381.6766
4   0.21         -148.1782
5   1.50          -18.2564
```

**Whales**
```R
  Length Predicted_Biomass
1   14.1        12627.1889
2    2.9          327.3169
3    2.1         -551.2454
4   13.8        12297.7281
5    6.2         3951.3863
```
### 3. Interpretation of R² and P-values

- **R² Value:**
  The R² value, also known as the coefficient of determination, indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (Biomass) that is predictable from the independent variable (Length). For example, in the Kelp regression, an R² of 0.9432 means that approximately 94.32% of the variation in Kelp biomass is explained by its length. A higher R² value suggests a better fit of the model to the data.
- **p-value:**
  The p-value assesses whether the relationship observed between Length and Biomass is _statistically_ significant. A small p-value (typically less than 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis (which posits no relationship between Length and Biomass), meaning that the observed relationship is unlikely to have occurred by chance. In both the Kelp and Whale models, the p-values are very small (1.79e-09 and 1.34e-06), suggesting that Length is a statistically significant predictor of Biomass for both organisms.

### 4. Predicting with Regression Equations vs. Using the Mean

- **Regression vs. Mean:**
  The regression equations provide a more precise and tailored prediction for Biomass based on the specific length of each organism, whereas using the mean Biomass only provides a general estimate for all organisms, irrespective of their length.
- **Why Regression is Better:**
  The regression models account for the relationship between Length and Biomass, which is especially important because Biomass tends to increase with Length in a non-linear fashion. Using the mean would ignore this relationship, leading to less accurate predictions. The high R² values in both models (94% for Kelp and 84% for Whale) indicate that Length is a strong predictor of Biomass, making regression the superior method for making predictions in this case. While the negative predicted biomasses doesn't make sense, it can be safely ignored in this case, using other (possibly non-linear) models in order for a realistic prediction.
