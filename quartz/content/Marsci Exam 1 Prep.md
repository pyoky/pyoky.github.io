### Cnidaria, Porifera: *Corals, Jellyfish, Sponges*
1. Corals are successful benthic animals that can monopolize space. Discuss 3 reasons that might explain why corals instead of sponges are the dominant space-holding invertebrates on most tropical, shallow water reefs.  Why do sponges tend to dominate reefs greater than 100m in depth? Hint: sponges also dominate deep underneath ledges on coral reefs. 
    - **Corals**:
        - Photosynthetic symbionts (zooxanthellae) aid in energy production.
        - Rapid skeleton growth to monopolizes space.
        - Strong competition for light in shallow waters.
    - **Sponges**:

        - Can survive in nutrient-poor environments.
        - Often dominate deeper reefs or under ledges.
2. Compare and contrast the feeding strategies used for prey capture and subjugation used by a hard coral, sponge, and sea walnut (ctenophore), with specific mechanisms.
3. Compare and contrast alternation of generation and polymorphism in the phylum Cnidaria. Give specific examples of each using specific species.

| Aspect            | Alternation of Generations                                               | Polymorphism                                                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| What it involves  | Alternating between **polyp (asexual)** and **medusa (sexual)** stages.  | Different specialized forms (zooids) in a colony.                         |
| Occurs in         | Species like **jellyfish** and some **hydrozoans**.                      | Mostly in **colonial cnidarians** (e.g., siphonophores).                  |
| Reproductive role | Involves both **asexual and sexual reproduction**.                       | Different zooids may specialize in **reproduction, feeding, or defense**. |
| Purpose           | Facilitates **life cycle completion** across habitats (benthic/pelagic). | Allows efficient **division of labour** within a colony.                  |
| Example species   | Moon jelly (**Aurelia aurita**).                                         | Portuguese man o’ war (**Physalia physalis**).                            |

- **Alternation of generations** enables individual cnidarians to switch between sessile and free-swimming forms, maximizing **reproductive success** and habitat utilization.
- **Polymorphism** enhances the efficiency of colonial life by assigning specific tasks (feeding, defense, reproduction) to **different zooids** within the colony.
- Together, these strategies exemplify the **diverse life history adaptations** that cnidarians have evolved to thrive in marine environments.
