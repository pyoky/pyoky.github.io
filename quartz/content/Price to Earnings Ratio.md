def. **Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ration).**

$$
\text{P/E}=\frac{\text{Share Price}}{\text{Earnings per Share}}=\frac{\text{MCAP}}{\text{Net Income}}
$$

⇒ Think: for two firms…

- …if the market values the shares higher,
- …even though the earnings are low,
- …the market thinks the firm has **growth potential.**

## How Good is the P/E Ratio?

- The P/E ratio contains finance information so it’s a **noisier** measure compared to the [[Measuring Security Performance]].
- It’s a better measure for the pure returns you get on the share.
  → EBITDA is a bigger, general rule of thumb, while P/E could be better for a small invester.

> [!info] Multiples analysis doesn’t show if the company is over- or under-valued. It’s a function of market’s value judgement of a firm. If you disagree with the multiples, it means you’re going against equity analysis in Wall Street, who do **fundamental analysis.**

> [!info] Both ratios are essentially: $\frac{\text{Company Size}}{\text{Profitability}}$, thus measuring the **growth** of the company.
