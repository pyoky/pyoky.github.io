In the internet, the problem is not finding content, but **finding good content.** Therefore, pick sparingly what you consume.
- Use RSS feeds to choose good sources to read
- When you have a list of content, pick out what you want, like how you would scoop a bucket from the river.
	- **Don't** try to read the whole thing. It's not efficient or useful.
	- Choose what seems enticing or relevant
	- Applies to articles, books, movies, tv shows, games, etc.
