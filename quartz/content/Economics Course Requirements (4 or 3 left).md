(ECON 500-549 may only be counted toward the major with approval from the director of undergraduate studies))

### **General Restrictions**

- A maximum of two economics transfer credits will be accepted toward the major. This applied to courses taken in the United States and to study abroad courses. One exception if the London School of Economics full-year (fall and spring) program, from which a maximum of four courses may be counted toward the major.
    - **Effective for courses taken after the Spring 2018 semester, we will no longer accept transfer credits for the following courses: ECON 204, ECON 205, ECON 208, and ECON 210.** Courses that are part of “Duke In …” programs count as Duke courses and not transfer courses (please note that a few “Duke In …” programs are hybrids in which some courses count as Duke courses but students may also take transfer courses at the foreign institution). Also, inter-institutional courses are not considered transfer courses, nor are pre-matriculation credits. If you have questions about whether a course taken away from Duke would be considered a transfer course, please consult the director of undergraduate studies or associate director of undergraduate studies before taking the course.
- DukeHub enforces prerequisites for many Economics courses.
- 1 Students with credit for both AP Macro and AP Micro (4 or higher) may receive credit for ECON 101. To receive credit for ECON 101 using an international standardized exam, please visit the [Trinity College policy for qualifying scores](http://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/credit-AP-IPC-PMC).
- 2 Prerequisites are enforced for ECON 205D. They include ECON 201, and **either** MATH 202 **or** MATH 212 **or** MATH 222.
- 3 Students are limited to counting a maximum of TWO Fintech courses toward the finance concentration requirements.
