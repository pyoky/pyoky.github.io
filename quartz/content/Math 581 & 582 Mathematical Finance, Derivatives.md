- **Payoff**: the gross outcome of an investment or trade. The amount you earned from that trade, regardless of commissions, extraneous costs, etc.
- **Profits**: the gross outcome of an investment or trade, including commissions, extraneous cost
	- â†’ the distinction happens in [[Options (Finance)]]. Payoffs don't consider the _option premium_, while the profits do.
- **Return**: short for "rate of return". The percentage of _profit_ (not payoff!) per original investment. Quoted in percentage (%) or log-returns.
