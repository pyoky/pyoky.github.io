Budget constraint with endowment

$$
p_{1}x_{1}+p_{2}x_{2}=\underbrace{p_{1}e_{1}+p_{2}e_{2}}_{\text{Endowments}}+I
$$

![[Utility Maximization with Endowments.jpeg]]

⇒ Whether the change in price leads to a utility increase or decrease depends on where your original optimum is; i.e.
- Whether you are a net seller or net buyer of the good (optimum is left/right of endowment)
- Which way the price ratio changes

## Leisure—Consumption Utility

Same equation as above, but with Consumption-[[Positive Leisure]] tradeoff

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Consumption} &=\text{Exogenous Income}+\text{Endowment} \\
wL+pc&=I+wT+pe
\end{align}
$$

…where…
- Labor quantities:
	- $w$: wage (=price of leisure)
	- $L$: quantity of leisure, in unit hours
	- $T$: total time endowment, in unit hours
- Consumption quantities:
	- $p$: price of _composite consumption_ good
	- $c$: quantity of composite consumption good
	- $e$: consumption endowment

[[Cobb-Douglas Utility (Two Goods)|Cobb-Douglas]]:

$$
\text{max}_{L,c}~u=L^\alpha c^{(1-\alpha)}~\text{such that}~wL+pc=I+wT+pe
$$

therefore we can plot the [[Uncompensated Demand curve|Ordinary Demand]] of Leisure (=Labor Supply)
- $c=\frac{\alpha(I+wT+pe)}{p}$ Ordinary Demand of Consumption
- $L=\frac{\alpha(I+wT+pe)}{w}$ Ordinary Demand of Leisure
	- $N\coloneqq T-L=T-\frac{\alpha(I+wT+pe)}{w}$ ==Ordinary [[Labor Supply|Supply of Labor]]==

### Taxation

Percentage tax $t$ on wage (=price of leisure)
⇒ removing $t$ from the wage

$$
w(1-t)L+pc=I+w(1-t)+pe
$$

- Tax Revenue ${\overbrace{(T-L)}^{\text{Time worked}}}\times \overbrace{wt}^{\text{Hourly tax}}$
- [[Laffer Curve]]
