The indirect utility function relates $(\text{Prices, Income})$ directly to [[utility]], assuming the person is utility-maximizing

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Utility Function: }& u: (x_{1},x_{2}) \mapsto \text{utility} \\
\text{Indirect Utility Function: }& v: (p_{1},p_{2},I) \mapsto \text{utility}\\
\end{align}
$$

<u>Derivation Process:</u>
- Use [[Constrained Optimization]] to derive [[Uncompensated Demand curve|Demand Functions]] $x_{1}(p_{1},p_{2},I),~x_{1}(p_{1},p_{2},I)$
- Substitute these demand functions into the original utility function $u(x_{1},x_{2})$ to get the indirect utility function.

<u>Properties</u>
- [[Homogenous Function|HD]]0 in $(\text{Prices},\text{Income})$ → ==Check after derivation!==
	- In other words, inflation in prices and income doesn't change utility
- Decreasing in prices ($\frac{\partial v}{\partial p_{1}},\frac{\partial v}{\partial p_{2}}<0$), Increasing in income ($\frac{\partial v}{\partial I}>0$)
	- → ==Check after derivation!==
- Use [[Roy's Identity]] to get back to the [[Uncompensated Demand curve|Marshallian Demand]].
