## Partitions and Probability

def. Sets $B_1…B_n$ is a partition of $B$ if and only if:

1. $B_1…B_n$ are pairwise disjoint
2. $B_1\cup … \cup B_n = B$

COR. if $B_1…B_n$ is pairwise disjoint $P(B_1\cup…\cup B_n)=P(B_1)+…+P(B_n)$

COR. if $B_1…B_n$ is a partition of $\Omega$ then $P(B_1\cup…\cup B_n)=1$

## Set Operations

- $|A|$ Cadinality of set $A$
- $A \times B$: Cartesian product of sets $A,B$
- $2^A$: all the subsets of $A$ [= power set of $A$]
