def. **Enterprise value.** The amout of money you have to pay to buy off the company, **including its financial oblications (net debt)**

$$
\text{Enterprise Value = Equity Value + Net Debt}\\
$$

where $\text{Net Debt = SR,LR debt  + min.inst.pref.stock} - cash$

- Net Debt > 0 when firm has more debt
- Net Debt < 0 when firm has more cash

def. **EBITDA Multiple.**

$$
\text{EBITDA Multiple}= \frac{EV}{EBITDA}=\frac{\text{Value}}{\text{Profit}}
$$

⇒ Think: For two firms…

- …if the market values one firm higher [=EV is higher] than another firm,
- …even if their profit is relatively smaller [=relative EBITDA], it implies that:
- …the market thinks the firm has **growth potential.**

The EBITDA Multiple is a good measure of **how good the operations are of a company** because…

- EBITDA doesn’t deduct financing costs.
- EBITDA can compare companies in similar industries about how good their operations are.
