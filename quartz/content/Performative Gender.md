### Key Points
- [[Judith Butler]], _Gender Trouble._
- "Performance"!= "Performative"
	- → Performative means that gender is not like a wardrobe of "gender" you can choose from every day.
	- ⇒ Instead, it means gender is [[Social Construct|constructed]] into being. It is not something that you can easily choose, due to [[Microphysics of Power|Microphysics of Power]] and other things
- Imagine gender as something like "I am a Duke student." You are not _born_ a duke student, nor is Duke a real physical fact of reality.
	- You partially chose, partially was embraced by Duke, the socially constructed organization.
	- Then gender is perfectly severed from biology (=disproves biological essentialism).
