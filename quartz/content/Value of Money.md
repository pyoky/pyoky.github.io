## Money's Role
1. Solves the problem of the double coincidence of wants
	1. Observe the [Edgeworth Box|420](https://d35w6hwqhdq0in.cloudfront.net/a5dba0236727b0e9ebdd2e3247646f31.jpg). This is a full barter system based on [[Utility Function|Indifference Curves]].
2. Functions as a claim on future consumption (=store of value, claim on future consumption)
	1. I give you the perishable food now ⇒ you give me a claim on future consumption. ![[Time Value of Money.png|220]]
	2. Discounting future value ← due to risk aversion and instant gratification (human psychology)

## Time Value of Money

⇒ Thus arises the **time value of money** and **financial markets**
- [[Future Value Calculations|Money is discounted]] using a discount rate (=[[Future Value Calculations|interest]])
- [[Financial markets]] are essential for a store of value

## Properties Required in Physical Money

1. Divisible ⇒ numerical money. You can divide it into as much as reasonable in transaction
2. Scarce ⇒ gold/silver is often used
3. Desirable ⇒ again, gold/silver.
4. Durable ⇒ metalic goods

See the [[Gold Standard]] for more information
