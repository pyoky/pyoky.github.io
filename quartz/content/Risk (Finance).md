def. **Risk** is related to the uncertainty in payment back when giving a loan.
- Example of a **riskless** investment is investing into the bank upto the _federal deposit insurance_ (~$100K)
- Types of risk include:
	- [[Credit]] Risk [counterparty risk]: the counterparty can fail to make the payment
	- Interest Risk: the market interest rate might change
	- Inflation Risk: the inflation is high so the money isnâ€™t worth much
- **Increased cash flow frequency** usually means **less risk.**

def. **Risk** in finance is equivalent to [[Variance|Standard Deviation]] in mathematics.
- Risk is proportional to the duration of investment (See [[Bond Price#Yield Curve (emperical)|bond yield curve]]).
