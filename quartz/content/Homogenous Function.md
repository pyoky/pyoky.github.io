def. Homogenous production function

$$
f(xz,xK,xN)=x^\lambda f(z,K,N)
$$

- $z$: Productivity
- $K$: Capital
- $N$: Labor
i.e. if the inputs are multiplied by $x$, the output is multiplied by $x^\lambda$.
	â‡’ **We say: "$f$ is a homogenous function of degree $\lambda$"**

- This implies we have **increasing returns to scale**
- [[Monotonic Transformation]] of a homogenous function is also homogenous.
