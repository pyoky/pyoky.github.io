> PDF.js uses workers to parse and render the PDF file. To keep things simple, weâ€™ll avoid bundling the workers and instead copy them to our public folder (named `public`) using the following:

```
cp ./node_modules/pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.worker.min.js ./public/
```

{and then you can do:}

```JS
pdfJS.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc =
				window.location.origin + '/pdf.worker.min.js';
```
