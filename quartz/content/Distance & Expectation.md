[[External/Evolutionary Game Theory]] perspective:
def. **Distance & Expectation** (=Degree of [[Credit|Trust]]) is a [[Fetishization]] of personal interaction that comes from [[Trust Escrow System]]s. The following is the process:
1. When we meet an unknown person (but one from a shared cultural [[Trust Escrow System|TES]]), then we rely on the TES and we trust it, instead of the person themselves. 
2. However through sharing and caring, i.e. the exchange of [[Favors]], and the human instinct of [[Reflection (Authenticity)|mirroring]] there develops (=fetishizes) a form of *bond/trust* (and people who feel such bonds are evolutionarily advantaged [[(Youtube) Why You Are Lonely and How to Make Friends|(source)]].
*Examples* of D&E in action:
- Your communication doesn't break down because you assume the [[Grice's Maxims|Cooperative Principle]]
- You eat food grown, cooked and served by a stranger
- You lend the bank your money, and expect them to return it to you in the future
- You live in big apartments with hundreds of total strangers
## 罪の文化

> [!quote] "Sharing & Caring", from [[(Youtube) Why You Are Lonely and How to Make Friends]]

- [[Reciprocity]]
- [[Asking & Giving Advice]]
	2. Friends / Family / Relatives
		- [[Favors|Favors]] are important. Don't hesitate to give and receive favors.
	3. Acquaintances / Business Relationships
		- Manners are to everybody. [[Stagecraft]] works for everybody that interacts with you.
- Similar levels of people can be used for similar roles in your life. [[Multidependence]].

- Where to Draw Lines. [[Self Before Others|Personal Priority]]
	- **You're not responsible for other people’s emotions**, unless they cross the “inner circle.“Even then, you shouldn't work on fixing other's emotions directly.
		- You're also not responsible for other people's emotions.
	- **Respecting Opinions** is unnecessary for those below a certain level of expertise in the topic (but don't show your disrespect).
	- **You need not allow any invasion of privacy** of any emotional topics. What you share is completely your prerogative.
	- **Events**. Go to events that…
		- I have no [[Self Before Others|personal priorities]] not to attend AND…
		- Are clearly beneficial to a relationship OR social organization inclusion

- Q. [[Be Nice|Being Nice]] vs Being Stupid
- A. **It depends**. On…
	- If your expectations match
	- [[Social Environment]] and culture
	- [[Communication]] beforehand
	- How nice the other person is

- Saying what you want
	- [[(Youtube) Why No One Can Understand Us Unless We Speak]]
	- [[Ask vs. Guess Culture]]. Because you're [[Pride|International]], you need to especially speak out in America, and speak indirectly in Asia.
	- [[Solipcism|We're notoriously bad at understanding each other]]. When we have something we want, we need to communicate it. Say it out loud, in a clear, concise way without loaded emotion. Do this early on, before the frustrations pile and liger and rot.
	- Though communication does not demand the other person to gratify our needs immediately it guarantees that our desires are communicated and will be a data point for the other person's future decision-making.

## 恥の文化

- Concentric Circles ([[(Book) 「甘え」の構造]])
	1. (Chosen) Family / Close Friends / Partnerships
		- Expectation: Listening & telling me important life situations/emotions. Being fully vulnerable.
		- Vulnerability.
			- Important in moving a casual friend to a [[Building a Friendship|close friend]].
			- Emotionally nurtures you. When the other person returns it, it nurishes you.
