## Economic Goods

Note:
- Normal Good $\subset$ Ordinary Good
- Giffen Good $\subset$ Inferior Good
### Depending on Price and Quantity Demanded
- **Ordinary Good**: Follows the Law of Demand: $\text{Price}\propto 1 / Q_{\text{Demand}}$
- **Giffen Good**: $\text{Price}\propto Q_{\text{Demand}}$
	- ⇒ Cause: Income Decrease ⇒ Buy cheaper Giffen Good
	- _Irish Famine._ the price of potatoes and meat increased subsequently. Compared to meat, potatoes could be much cheaper as a staple food.
		- ⇒ Potatoes were a Giffen Good

### Depending on Income and Quantity Demanded

> [!info] Notation:
> - YED:= Income elasticity of demand-
> - [[Income Effect (IE)]] is important in understanding economic goods

-[](Income%20Effect%20(IE).md)xt{Income} \propto Q_\text{Demand}$
	- i.e. $\frac{\partial x_{1}(p_{1},p_{2},\bar{I})}{\partial I}>0$ (derivative from [[Uncompensated Demand curve|Marshallian Demand]])
	- **Necessity Good** (Necessities)
		- $0<\frac{\partial x_{1}}{\partial I}<1$
	- **Luxury Good**
		- $1<\frac{\partial x_{1}}{\partial I}$
		- …i.e. a normal good for which the proportional consumption increase exceeds the proportional Increase
- **Inferior Good**: $\text{Income} \propto 1/Q_\text{Demand}$
	- i.e. $\frac{\partial x_{1}}{\partial I}<0$
- **Quasilinear Good**: $Q_\text{Demand}$ doesn't change on income change
	- i.e. $\frac{\partial x_{1}}{\partial I}=0$

For the set of all goods we can thus show the following _Venn diagram_:

- Common-pool resources are also called **_Common Goods._**
- Public Goods
	- The production of a public good is a [[Prisoner's Dillemma]] situation.
	- Basic examples: national defense, street lighting, a good schooling district, etc.
