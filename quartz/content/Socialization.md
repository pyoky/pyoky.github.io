Socialization is the process of inducting or hailing a person into a [[Social Institution]] or organization.
- Mass media is a form of socialization into a nation's cultural identity. It communicates what [[Normative Scripts|scripts]] one must follow in this society, what its [[Normative Scripts|Gender Roles]] are, what the [[Special Social Dates]] and special holidays are.
- On a smaller scale, socialization into a [[Social Organization]] involves not only e.g. pledge, induction ceremony, etc., but also a continuous form of socialization during membership.
- An important aspect of socialization is [[Collective Knowledge]]â€”a shared understanding of the past. This can mean the history of a nation, or the past drama in a club.
