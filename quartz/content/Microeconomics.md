## Economics as a Science

Economics is a science as it creates **hypotheses** and **conducts experiments** if they are correct.

- Since you can’t often create tests IRL, econometrics deals with interpreting real-world data as a substitute for an experiment
- _Experimental economics_ is a small discipline where you actually conduct experiments

(This is not as scientific as it seems. See [[Philosophy, Political Science, Economics]])

## Building Blocks of Microeconomics

Assume: People are **rational** in their pursuit of **perceived self-interests**. Such people are called **economic agents**.

→ …thus people respond to _incentives_

→ …then as a consequence of multiple economic agents interacting, there will emerge **social consequences.**

## Economic Modeling

Modeling in economics is a process of _distilling the essence_ of a real-world phenomenon, in order to make predictions about the real world.

> [!info] Model → Optimization → Equilibrium

- _**Model**_: form a model that describes an economic phenomena (make **assumptions,** Ceteris Paribus)
- _**Optimization**_: consider how economic agents will interact within such assumptions & models. Use math if necessary.
- _**Equilibrium**_: predict what will ultimately happen in such a model? What is the ending point? (make **predictions**)

(Economically, an _equilibrium (=Pareto Equilibrium)_ is a point where no agent can be better off without making another agent worse off)

> [!info] A good model _doesn’t need to have realistic assumptions_. It just needs to predict reality really well.

→ _Consider_: A good pool player doesn’t need to know kinematics to score well. Similarly an economic model doesn’t need realistic assumptions if it can realistically predict real-world economic phenomena.

## Other Key Points

1. **The world isn’t a zero sum game.** Adam Smith: think of purchasing a piece of bread at $2. You get the bread, and you are better off. The breadmaker values the bread at less than $2, so they’re better off.
2. **Attribution Bias.** People’s actions are due more to the sum of the incentives acting on them, rather than their inherent quality. Don’t attribute it to their personality.
3. **[[Decentralization]]**. The rules of the economic game shapes a _bottom-up spontaneous order_ that shapes the world and rations limited resources.
