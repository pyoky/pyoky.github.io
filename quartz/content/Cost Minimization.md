## Long Run Cost Minimization

$$
min_{l,k} ~C=wl+rk ~\text{such that} ~x=f(x)
$$

- [[Lagrangian Optimization|Lagrangian Optimization]]
- Optimal when Isoquant is tangent to the isocost
	- Higher isoquant is not always better! it just means you're producing more

> [!warning]
> Beware when $MC$ is monotonically decreasing. This means that the firm will produce zero or infinity, which is means it is a special case which you need to analyze separately.
