Assume you consume _only_ pasta and steak. As exogenous income rises, you consume more steak, and less pasta. In this case, steak is a **normal good**, while pasta is an **inferior good**.

def. The **Income effect** is a change in consumption _only due to income_

**Absolute** changes in consumption define **normal/quasi-linear/inferior** goods

> [!info] Income↑…consumption**↑** — **Normal Good**
> Income↑…consumption **_same_** — **Quasi-linear Good**
> Income↑…consumption**↓** — **Inferior Good**

On the other hand, **relative** changes in consumption define **luxury/homothetic/necessary** goods.

```
+% Income > +% consumption — **Luxury Good
+%** Income = +% consumption — **Homothetic Good
+%** Income < +% consumption — **Necessary Good**
```
