- The Personal Computer is an extension of the brain, a [Bicycle of the Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L40B08nWoMk).
- The personal computer is not a [[Tools and Structures Define Your Capacity|tool]]. Instead, it is a _person you have a relationship with._
	- This is because you do not fully control your computer (!=definition of a tool). You influence your computer, and the computer influences you back.
	- The relationship can be positive or negative.
- The personal computer is the interface and vehicle with which you explore the [[Living With the Internet|internet universe]].
- [(DevonThink) How To Become A Hacker](x-devonthink-item://A3E4439E-817E-4E38-9F58-20C07F8CEDAE) This is the gospel for behaving within a culture of hackers. Things that particularly stand out is about _asking good questions_, _discipline and competence_, and [[Lifelong Learning]].

- **[[Decentralization]]**
	- Key components of your computer systems should follow [[Decentralization|decentralized]] models
	- e.g. ActivityPub > Twitter
	- e.g. IPFS > HTTPS
	- This also comes out of the [[Multidependence|principle of multidependence]].
	- **Open-source** instead of closed-source
		- e.g. Linux > macOS
- **Own Your data**
	- Services that pay for you to access your own data will eventually disappear. Own your data.
	- Your disk space should be *~1/3 empty.* Keep it at that to allow for flexibility but not wasted space.
	- Plaintext is the best format.
- [[Everything is a File]]
	- Don’t use Windows objects, proprietary databases for notes or databases that you don’t own. Systems that don’t embrace this approach will eventually likely fail.
- **Software Maturity**
	- Install mature software only (Operating Systems, etc.)

	- e.g. Obsidian > Notion (business pivot)
- Know to Surface Data
	- Photos go into where you view photos the most (Apple Photos library). Documents go where documents are surfaced the most (DevonThink).
	  ⇒ Data should be surface-able, like [[(Article) Evergreen notes]]

	- A "language calculator"
	- Everybody gets a 100 interns. ([GPT: The Second Renaissance - No Boilerplate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glpR1MD1UoM))
