**Measurment Metrics.** The following are used commonly to measure performance of funds. It does not imply, however, that they are meaningful, useful, or correct. Most of them compare [[Risk (Finance)|risk]] to return

1. [[Measuring Security Performance]][[Measuring Security Performance]]io]]
2. Jenson’s Alpha. Measures performance **against CAPM’s Predictions.**

$$
\alpha=(r_i-r_f)-\beta(r_m-r_f)
$$

### Sharpe Ratio

def. Sharpe Ratio. The sharpe ratio for portfolio with return $R_{p}$

$$
\begin{align}
SP&=\frac{E[R_{p}-\mu_{f}]}{\sigma_{p}} \\
&=\frac{\mu_{p}-\mu_{f}}{\sigma_{p}}
\end{align}
$$

- Used to compare securities given their risk & returns
- Measures the "risk-normalized return"
- Higher means a better risk/return profile

### Treinor's Ratio
Measures the *return* per unit of *market risk* taken. Higher is better.
$$
\text{TM}=\frac{E[\text{Excess return}]}{\beta}
$$
Reminder: [[Market Beta]] is about how correlated the asset is to the market.



### EBITDA Multiple

def. **Enterprise value.** The amout of money you have to pay to buy off the company, *including its financial oblications (net debt)*

$$
\text{Enterprise Value = Equity Value + Net Debt}\\
$$

where $\text{Net Debt = SR,LR debt  + min.inst.pref.stock} - cash$

- Net Debt > 0 when firm has more debt
- Net Debt < 0 when firm has more cash

def. **EBITDA Multiple.**

$$
\text{EBITDA Multiple}= \frac{EV}{EBITDA}=\frac{\text{Value}}{\text{Profit}}
$$

⇒ Think: For two firms…
- …if the market values one firm higher [=EV is higher] than another firm,
- …even if their profit is relatively smaller [=relative EBITDA], it implies that:
- …the market thinks the firm has **growth potential.**

The EBITDA Multiple is a good measure of **how good the operations are of a company** because…

- EBITDA doesn’t deduct financing costs.
- EBITDA can compare companies in similar industries about how good their operations are.
