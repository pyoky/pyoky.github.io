**Measurment Metrics.** The following are used commonly to measure performance of funds. It does not imply, however, that they are meaningful, useful, or correct. Most of them compare [[Risk (Finance)|risk]] to return

1. [[Measuring Security Performance]][[Measuring Security Performance]]io]]
2. Jenson’s Alpha. Measures performance **against CAPM’s Predictions.**

$$
\alpha=(r_i-r_f)-\beta(r_m-r_f)
$$

### Sharpe Ratio

def. Sharpe Ratio. The sharpe ratio for portfolio with return $R_{p}$

$$
\begin{align}
SP&=\frac{E[R_{p}-\mu_{f}]}{\sigma_{p}} \\
&=\frac{\mu_{p}-\mu_{f}}{\sigma_{p}}
\end{align}
$$

- Used to compare securities given their risk & returns
- Measures the "risk-normalized return"
- Higher means a better risk/return profile

### Treinor's Ration

Measures against **Systematic (=market) Risk.**

$$
\text{TM}=\frac{E[\text{Excess return}]}{\beta}
$$

Reminder: [[Market Beta]] is about how correlated the asset is to the market.
