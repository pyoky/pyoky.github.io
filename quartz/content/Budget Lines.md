⇒ Similar to the Possibility Frontier (PPF), but like a "consumption possibility frontier".

> [!info]
  You will often plot all other consumed goods into one combined good, as the **“$ of other consumption”** with unit $.

$I=p_1x_1+p_2x_2$—Equation of the budget constraint
- y-intercept: $\frac{I}{p_2}$ → if you buy only $x_{2}$
- x-intercept: $\frac{I}{p_{1}}$ → if you buy only $x_{1}$
- gradient: $-\frac{p_1}{p_2}$
	- → Opportunity cost of one unit of $x_1$ **in terms of $x_2$.**
	- negative, since for additional consumption of $x_1$ you lose your ability to consume $x_2$.

## Change in Budget Lines

- Exogenous change in income $I$

	- When price of good $x_1$ decreases (i.e. $p_1$ decreases) intercept $\frac{I}{p_2}$ stays the same, gradient $\frac{p_1}{p_2}$ increases. Vice versa when $p_2$ changes.

	- Endowments are a particular basket of goods you get for free; it’s a single point in the graph—in this case, (5 pants, 10 shirts) is the endowment.
- Progressive Taxes
- Inter-temporal Budgets
