def. **Marginal Rate of Substitution**. $MRS_{1,2}$ asks "How much of $x_{2}$ can you give me for one unit of $x_{1}$?"
- $\text{MRS}_{1,2}$ means MRS of good $x_{1}$ for good $x_{2}$, i.e. "one unit of $x_{1}$ for how many units of $x_{2}$?""

$$
\text{MRS}_{1,2}:=-\frac{dx_2}{dx_1}=-\frac{\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_{1}}}{\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_2}}
$$

> [!warning] The $x_{1},x_{2}$ changes spots in the nominator/denominator in the final formula.

- The tangent of [[Utility Function]] at a certain point is the MRS at that specific point (more accurately, its absolute value of the tangent)
- [[Rationality (Economics)|Convexity Assumption]] causes MRS to decrease (=Diminishing MRS) rightward (the more of good $x_1$ we consume, the more we would like $x^2$).
- When two people have different MRS, then they can **trade** for both of their utility.
	- e.g. $MRS_A = -3$, $MRS_B=-\frac{1}{2}$
	- ⇒ they can trade at any rate where $MRS_A < \text{rate} < MRS_B$ to both of their benefit.

## Deriving the MRS Formula

We’re looking for a place on the scalar field provided by $u(x_1,x_2)$ where the gradient is zero.
⇒ Thus we need to find a point where the following is true:

$$
\nabla u(x_1,x_2) = \frac{\delta u}{\delta x_1}dx_1 + \frac{\delta u}{\delta x_2}dx_2=0
$$

By the definition of MRS it’s the gradient of a indifference curve, i.e. the gradient of a level curve in the field:

$$
MRS=-\frac{dx_2}{dx_1}=- \frac{\partial u / \partial x_{1}}{\partial u / \partial x_{2}}
$$

## Changes in MRS

- MRS can change due to _exogenous_ factors; in this case the whole indifference curve will change accordingly too.
- e.g. After 9.11., air travel is perceived by consumers to be less safe.

- Observe that air travel becoming less safe, causes the MRS to decrease, as one is willing to trade less money for flying by air.
- You can think of this from a different perspective by instead of thinking of air safety as an exogenous factor, actually quantifying air safety as a measure as well, and graphing it together.
- Graphing air safety as the third axis shows that we can in fact visualize the decrease in MRS of air miles and $'s of other consumption.
