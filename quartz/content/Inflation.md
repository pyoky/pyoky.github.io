Inflation:= change in the price of the **basket of goods** [= a representative sample of GDP]

$$
I.R.=\frac{P_t-P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}}
$$

- Interest rate $\propto$ inflation rate [← explained later]
- Historically, price of capital equipment (relative to consumption goods) have gone down
  …but the price of housing have gone up
  → thus must know **inflation of what?**
	- **Total Inflation**: CPI measured using the representative basket of goods
	- **Core Inflation**: represents the long run trend in the price level.
		- In measuring long run [inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation "Inflation"), transitory price changes should be excluded.
		- ⇒ Exclude items frequently subject to volatile prices, like food and energy
		- i.e. the change in **Core CPI**

- Inflation data is often shown as Year-over-Year (YoY) which means you can't compound
