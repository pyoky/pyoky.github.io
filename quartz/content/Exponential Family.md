def. Expoential Family of Distributions is the distributions whose pdfs are in the following form:

$$
f_{X}(x|\theta)=h(x)\cdot \text{exp}\Big[
\eta(\theta)T(x)-A(\eta)
\Big]
$$

Includes:

- [[Normal Distribution]]
- [[Exponential Distribution]]
- [[Chi-Squared]]
- Beta
- Diriochelt
- [[Bernouilli Distribution]]
- [[Poisson Distribution]]

As well as:

- [[Binomial Distribution]] (with fixed number of trials)
- [[Multinomial Distribution]] (with fixed number of trials),
- Negative binomial (with fixed number of failures)
- [[Hypergeometric Distribution|Geometric]] (Not Hypergeometric!)
