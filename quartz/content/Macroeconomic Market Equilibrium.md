## General Equilibrium

![Untitled](Untitled%2016.png)

**Market Equilibrium** is a point that is both optimal and feasible:

1. Optimality: HHs, firms, govn’t are maximally happy; $\pi$, $u$ maximized, government plan is in place
2. Feasibility: Budget/Resource Constraints are in action

### Feasibility

1. Labor Market: $N^S=N^D$
2. Goods Market: $Y^S=C+G$ ←“Resource Constraint”
3. HH income: $C+T=wN+\pi$ ←”Consumer Budget Constraint”
4. Government $G=T$ ←”Government Budget Constraint”

⇒ If the two of three budget constraints are satisfied, the other one is automatically satisfied

## Deriving the Equilibrium

### 1. Production Possibility Frontier

- PPF indicates current level of technology, levels of govn’t spending
- _Gradient of the PPF_ is the Marginal Rate of Transformation ($MRT$) of the economy; i.e. opportunity cost of transforming between consumption and leisure. **This is equivalent to wage.**
- Government speding is indicated by a downward shift of the PPF

### 2. Household Optimization

- Consider: even if households do not work, they will get $\pi+\text{Net Transfers}$ amount of income

### 1+2: Market Equilibrium

![Untitled](Untitled%203%203.png)

At Point $A^*(C^*,L^*)$:

- Firms produce maximally, HHs maximize utility
- Is feasible [=inside PPF, inside HH budget constraint]
- $MRS=MRT =-w$

> [!info] Examples of Disequilibrium
> → The left case: $MRS=MRT$ but is infeasible $\because$ household indifference curve is outside
> → The right case: feasible, but household utility is not maximized

## Changes in Equilibrium

1. Changes in Government Spending [= $G$], normally due to war, or infrastructure projects

![Untitled](Untitled%205%201.png)

> [!info] Government can crowd out private consumption, because it reduces HH income (income effect):

Taxes↑ ⇒ HH income ↓ ⇒ $Y^D$↓ ⇒ $N^S$↓ ⇒ $Y$ likely increases $\because$ $\overset{\uparrow} Y=\overset{\downarrow}C+\overset{\Uparrow}G$
