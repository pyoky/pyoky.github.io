The Beige Book is a report published by the [[Federal Reserve]] that provides qualitative information on current economic conditions across the 12 Federal Reserve Districts. It is published eight times per year and is used by policymakers, economists, and investors to gain insights into the state of the economy. The report relies on information gathered from various sources, including surveys of businesses and interviews with key contacts in each district.
