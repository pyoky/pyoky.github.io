- **Payoff**: the gross outcome of an investment or trade. The amount you earned from that trade, regardless of commissions, extraneous costs, etc.
- **Profits**: the gross outcome of an investment or trade, including commissions, extraneous cost
	- â†’ the distinction happens in [[Options (Finance)]]. Payoffs don't consider the _option premium_, while the profits do.
- **Return**: short for "rate of return". The percentage of _profit_ (not payoff!) per original investment. Quoted in percentage (%) or log-returns.

## Risk-Neutral Assumption

A risk-neutral world is where there is no risk premium on return. This implies:
- All [[Present Value Calculations]] are done at the risk-free rate
- All assets have risk-free rate of return (=zero ri[[Assumptions in Derivative Pricing]]itrage Condition]] holds
- & This is not really realistic, but simplifies calculations a lot.

## No Arbitrage Condition (=Law of One Price)

No arbitrage condition means without any risk, there cannot be excess return (=return above risk-free rate).

Law of One Price states that:
1. let security $A$ have payoff $p_{A}$, cost $c_{A}$ and $B$ payoff $p_{B}$, cost $c_{B}$.
2. If $p_{A}=p_{B}$ then $c_{A}=c_{B}$
