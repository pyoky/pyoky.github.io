def. Profit Function. Given input and output prices, returns the maximum achievable profit.

$$
\pi(w,r,p)
$$

### (HowTo) Derive Profit Function
1. Get [[Input Demand and Output Supply]].
2. Substitute into the profit equation
	1. $\pi=p\cdot x(w,r,p)-w\cdot l(w,r,p)-r\cdot k(w,r,p)$

### Properties
- HD1 in $w,r,p$
- Increasing in $p$
- Decreasing in $w,r$
- [[Hotelling's Lemma]] applies
