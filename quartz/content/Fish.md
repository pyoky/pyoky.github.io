### Typology

### External Morphology
![[Fish-20240924124127857.png]]
Fins are the important part:
1. Caudal fin determines sustained speed of fish.
    1. Split & Pointy: slow to start; fast sustained speeds
    2. Round & Big: instant start; slower sustained speeds
    - Can be asymmetric (=_heteroceral_) or symmetric (=_homoceral_)
2. Pelvic fins & Pectoral Fins. Auxiliary steering. Sometimes _radiation_ like lionfish for predation/mating
3. Dorsal Fin determines the size of the fish ‚Üê important for predation
Other features
- Mouths: _Superior_ (upwards-facing), _Inferior_ (downwards-facing) or _Terminal_ (forward-facing). Determines what the fish eats. Eyes are always forward or upward facing to avoid prey.
Overall body types
- Deep-Body
- Lie-and-wait predators
- Rover Predators
- Bottom Feeders
- Bottom Clingers
- Eel-like
### Feeding
- Cannot eat fish that are bigger than their mouths

### Senses
