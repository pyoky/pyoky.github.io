## Problem 1

### Algorithm

```psudo
# each item is in format (time, start/end, event_index)
# order priosity: smaller time -> start ->
Q = sort(L, R)
Events = []

while Q has elements:

	if Q.next is a start time
		t <- Q.dequeue

		# if there is a tie in start times
		while Q.next.start_time == t.start_time:
			t <- max_end_time(t, Q.dequeue)
			
		# t is now the earliest starting time with maximum duration
	
	else Q.next is an end time

		# get latest end time
		while Q.next is an end time
			t <- Q.dequeue
			
		# t is now the latest end time
		
	add t's event to Events
	
	end if
end while

```

### Complexity
- Sorting: $O(n\log n)$
- Loop: $O(n)$
- ⇒ Total: $O(n\log n)$

### Correctness
- Base case
	1. Let $Y^*=(y_{1},\dots)$ the optimal solution
	2. Assume $Y^*$'s $y_{1}$ is not the earliest start time……(1)
	3. Algorithm chooses earliest start time $x_{1}$.
		1. $[x_{1}.\text{start},y_{1}.\text{start}]$ is in total cover, but not in $Y^*$'s cover.
		2. This means $Y^*$ cannot be optimal. This is a contradiciton
		3. Thus Assumption (1) must be wrong
- Inductive Step
	1. Let $Y^*=(x_{1}\dots x_{k-1},y_{k},\dots)$ is the optimal solution
	2. $Y^*$'s $y_{k}$ is the optimal next choice after $x_{k-1}$
	3. Case 1: next item in priority queue is an end time
		1. Algorithm chooses $x_{k}$ where…
			1. $x_{k}.\text{start}<x_{k-1}.\text{end}$
			2. $x_{k}.\text{end}<y_{k+1}.\text{start}$
			3. among such points, $\text{max}(x_{k}.end)$
		2. Assume $y_{k}$ is an event that doesn't satisfy the maximum endtime requirement……(2)
			1. Then, $[y_{k}.\text{end},x_{k}.\text{end}]$ is in total cover, but not in $Y^*$'s cover. This is a contradiction.
			2. Thus assumption (2) must be wrong
	4. Case 2: next item in priority queue is a start time
		1. Algorithm chooses $x_{k}$ with the earliest starting time and longest duration
		2. This is at least as optimal as $y_{k}$, because…
			1. $x_{k}.\text{start}\leq y_{k}.\text{start}$
			2. $x_{k}.\text{end}\leq y_{k}.\text{end}$
			3. Thus the cover of $x_{k}$ is as large as $y_{k}$
		3. Thus $x_{k}$ is as optimal as $y_{k}$

## Problem 2

```psudo
// Idea: Reverse the order of weights in the graph,
// then run minimum spanning tree.

// First, reverse the weight ordering of the graph

// negate weights...
for e in E
	e' <- e
	e'.weight <- -e.weight
	add e' to E'

let m be the edge with minimum weight in E'

// then monotonically increase so all weights are positive 
// (to use MST algorithm)
for e in E'
	e'.weight += m.weight + 1

// Then, run MST algorithm (Prim or Kruskal)
V_mst, E_mst <- MST(V, E')

// the minimum spanning tree in (V, E') is
// same as the maximum spanning tree in (V, E)

// Return the edges that are not in the MST.
return E \ E_mst
```

### Correctness
- The problem is equivalent to getting a tree whose sum of edge weights is maximal.
	- This is because the remaining graph must be acyclic (a tree) and…
	- …because the sum of removed weights is minimal thus the sum of remaining weights must be maximal.
- We can convert the original graph in question to a weight order reversed graph:
	- Suppose $E=\{e_{1},e_{2},\dots,e_{m}\}$ where $e_{i}$ has weight $w_{i}$
	- Then, $E'=\{ e_{1}',\dots e_{m}'\}$ where $e_{i}'$ has weight $w_{m-i+1}$
- Then, we can leverage the correctness of the MST algorithm (prim's or kruskal's) in order to get the minimum spanning tree of this new weight-order-reversed-graph.
- The edges in this MST is the maximum spanning tree in the original graph
- Therefore, removing these edges we are left with the subset $F$ which is minimal

### Complexity
- negating weights: $O(m)$
- monotonically raising weights positive: $O(m)$
- MST algorith: $O(m\log n)$
- Total: $O(m\log n)$
