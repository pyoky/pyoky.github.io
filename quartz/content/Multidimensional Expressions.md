def. **Online Analytical Processing (OLAP)** is a form of data storage and management (similar to a  [[Database Management System|relational database]]), but with multiple dimensions. While RDBMS is general-purpose, OLAP is more specific to data aggregation and analysis, mostly for business purposes.
