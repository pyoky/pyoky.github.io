### **Prerequisites (Done)**

- One of the following introductory COMPSCI courses or equivalent:
	- COMPSCI 101L (Introduction to Computer Science)
	- COMPSCI 102 (Interdisciplinary Introduction to Computer Science)
	- COMPSCI 116 (Foundations of Data Science)
- MATH 111L (Introductory Calculus I) or equivalent
- MATH 112L (Introductory Calculus II) or equivalent

### Base Requirements (Done)

- ==COMPSCI 201 (Data Structures and Algorithms)==
- ==COMPSCI 230 (Discrete Math for Computer Science) **[see substitutions](https://www.cs.duke.edu/undergrad/substitutions)**==
- ==COMPSCI 250 (Computer Architecture)==
- ==COMPSCI 330 (Design & Analysis of Algorithms)==

### <u>One</u> Of the following COMPSCI Courses on Systems: (Done)

- COMPSCI 310 (Introduction to Operating Systems) or 510 (Advanced Operating Systems)
- ==COMPSCI 316 (Introduction to Databases)== or 516 (Database Systems)
- COMPSCI 350 (Digital Systems, cross-listed as ECE 350) or 550 (Advanced Computer Architecture, cross-listed as ECE 552)
- COMPSCI 351 (Computer Security) or 551 (Advanced Computer Security)*
- COMPSCI 356 (Computer Network Architecture) or 514 (Computer Networks)

### **Two** Courses in MATH/STA: (Done)

- One STA course at or above STA 111**, including the cross-listed ==MATH 230==
- One of MATH 202, 216, 218, or ==221==***

### Five Electives at 200-level or Higher (beyond Those Counted towards the Requirements above): (1 left)

- Three COMPSCI courses that are not independent study courses
    - ==CS 334 Formal Languages==
    - ==CS 545 Algorithmic game theory==
    - ==[[CS 675 Deep Learning]]==
- Two in COMPSCI (independent study possible), MATH, STA, or a related area approved by the Director of Undergraduate Studies
    - ==Math 212 (this is allowed, see below)==
    - ==STAT 432 Stat. Inference & Learning==

Both courses have been offered as a 290 and 590 course with the same name, and will satisfy this requirement.
- STA 111 will not be offered after Summer 2020. We recommend you take STA 199 or higher.

**MATH 212 does not count towards this requirement, but can count towards an elective.
