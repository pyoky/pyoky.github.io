Vector Algebra

- $a^Ta=|a|^2$ is a scalar. $aa^T$ is an $n\times n$ matrix.
- $|a|=\sqrt{ a_{1}^2+\dots+a_{n}^2}$

Matrix can be
- Symmetric
	- Positive-definite
	- Positive-semi-definitie
	- Negative-definite
	- Negative-semi-definite
- Diagonal: entries outside the [[main diagonal]] are all zero
	- Diagonalizable: $A$ is diagonalizable iff exists invertible matrix $P$ where $PAP^{-1}$ is a diagonal matrix
		- Inverse of a diagonalizable matrix is also diagonalizable
		- Orthogonally diagonalizable: $A$ is orthogonally diagonizable iff exists orthogonal matrix $P$ where $PAP^T=PAP^{-1}=I$
- Invertible vs Singular
	- Invertible: There exists an inverse = determinant is non-zero $|A|\neq 0$
		- The inverse of a symmetric matrix is also symmetric
	- Singular: There does not exist an inverse
	- $AA^{-1}=I$
- Orthogonal:$A$ is orthogonal iff $A^{-1}=A^T$

- Rank:= dimension of the vector space generated by its columns
- Identity Matrix $I$
- Determinant: scalar value that determines if the matrix has a determinant

Matrix Algebra Identities
- Non-commutative
	- Commutative only with scalars
- Distributive (w.r.t. matrix addition)
- Associative
	- Computational complexity depends on which you multipliy first: [[Matrix Chain Multiplication]]
- Transpose-distribution $(AbC)^T=C^TbA^T$
- Inverse-distribution $(AB)^{-1}=B^{-1}A^{-1}$
- Transpose-Inverse $(A^T)^{-1}=(A^{-1})^T$
