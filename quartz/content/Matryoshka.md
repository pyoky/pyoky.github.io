## Article Annotation[^1]

The note-taking of a text document has multiple layers
1. Highlights and notes (margin notes) on text
2. Separate typed/listed notes
3. Free diagram notes
These notes should be separated as a new markdown document on top of the actual document. The app you use depends on the medium:
4. PDFs → PDF Expert to annotate → Devonthink exports highlights and notes to Obsidian
5. Web Articles → Readwise to annotate → Readwise syncs highlights and notes to Obsidian
Then, when reviewing these notes you can look at source (Readwise or DT) and notes (Obsidian)
