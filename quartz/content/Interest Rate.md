## Rates in General

def. **Rate** is a simple abstraction of interest rate so that we can calculate things easily.

$$
\begin{align}
R&= \frac{F(\tau)-F(0)}{F(0)} & \text{ (Definition)}\\ 
&= \tau \cdot r& \text{ (...for simple interest)}\\
&=\left( 1+\frac{r}{k} \right)^{\tau k} -1 &\text{ (...for compound interest)} \\

\end{align}
$$

e.g. when banks say they have an APR (Annual Percentage Rate) of 10.99%, their actual rate \[=Annual Percentage Yield] is:

$$
R=\left( 1+\frac{10.99\%}{365} \right)^{365}-1 \approx 11.61\%
$$

def. **Required Rate of Return (RRR)** (=Discount Rate).
- RRR of asset: Minimum amount of profit that the investor will accept
- RRR in general: Average rate of similar-risk investments in the market

def. **Internal Rate of Return (IRR).**
- Annual rate of growth of an investment.
- Solution of the equation $\text{NPV}(r_{\text{IRR}}) \overset{\text{set}} =0$
