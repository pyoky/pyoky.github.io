Notes from [What Power Is — Michel Foucault](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTJNOEvCQFY)

Basics
- 20C thinker
- [[Postmodernism]]

Misconceptions of Power
- Hierarchical power is only a part
	- → instead, power is an oceanic **force of nature**
- Theoretical vs Empirical
	- Focault talks both about theoretical and empirical power
	- **_Emperical_**: sexuality, prison systems, etc. (historical crystallizations)
	- **_Theoretical_**: generalized, abstract conception, a "theory of power"
- Prior political analyses of power: misconception
	- e.g. 1984, [[Centralized Power|Leviathan]], Marx's class relations
	- characterized as the struggle between powerful vs not powerful
	- most power here is negative power (punishes)
	- originates probably from the western legalistic tradition
	- → but majority of power is not this (misrepresentation)

Immanent "microphysics" of power
- invisible, but real and measurable
- power is a quality of the social world (not metaphysical, natural force like Nietzche)
- intentional & non-subjective (e.g. party DJ putting on "Killing me softly")
	- **intentional**: you are technically free.
	- **non-subjective**: people will find you uncool

Resistance
- Resistance is not exterior to power, but is intrinsic
- revolutionaries → if there is no resistance, there is no power
- relations of power is only allowed in a free society
	- "free" in that you're technically free to resist

Full Definition of Power
- **"Power must be understood in the first instance as the multiplicity of force relation imminent in the sphere in which they operate"**
- e.g. dressing for school
	- legal, etc. (traditional)
	- school clique
	- "what's cool"
- ⇒ They all operate simultaneously

Relations of Power
- Local force relations act on each other (even in the absence of the individual to act on)
	- e.g. war. Discipline & punish: [[Checks and Balances|perpetual battle]]
- struggle, strengthen, weaken. etc
- They can also [[Dialectical Synthesis|bond & combine]]
	- e.g. fashion + peers, school + parents kinda match

[[Social Institution|Institutional]] Crystallization (social)
- "tactics" of power
- local micro-physics of power → coalesce to create school & state, bigger power
- nobody individually can predict the effects of micro-power
- e.g. legal, agreement, new forms of government
