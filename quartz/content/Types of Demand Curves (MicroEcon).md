## Demand Curves

Demand is a relationship between _prices_, _income_, and _quantity_ consumed.

$$
\text{Exogenous}:(p_1,p_2,I) \leftrightarrow \text{Endogenous}: (x_1,x_2)
$$

Properties relating these variables are:
- $x_{1}\leftrightarrow I$: Income Elasticity of Demand (YED)
- $x_{1} \leftrightarrow x_{2}$: [[Elasticity of Substitution]] (EoS)
- $p_{1} \leftrightarrow x_{1}$: Own-price Demand Curvesâ€¦
	1. [[Uncompensated Demand curve]]
		- = Ordinary Demand Curve
		- = Marshalian Demand Curve
	2. [[Marginal Willingness to Pay|Compensated Demand Curve]]
		- = Marginal Willingness to Pay Curve
		- = Hicksian Demand Curve
- $p_{1} \leftrightarrow x_{2}$: [[Cross-Price Demand Curve]]
	- $p_{1}\leftrightarrow x_{2}$: Cross Elasticity of Demand (XED)
