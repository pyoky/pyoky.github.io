[Cooperative principle - Wikiwand](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cooperative_principle)

When conversation breaks down, or it feels awkward, one of these maxims are often not upheld:

1. Maxim of **Quantity** (Length & Depth)
	1. Content should be informative
	2. Context should be no longer than necessary
2. Maxim of **Quality** (Truth)
	1. One should tell the truth
3. Maxim of **Relation** (Relevance)
	1. Content should be immediately relevant information
	2. [[Natural Transitions]] are important
4. Maxim of **Manner** (Clarity)
	1. One should avoid ambiguity
	2. Content should be ordered

> [!example]
> A (to passer by): I am out of gas.
> B: There is a gas station round the corner.
> - Quantity: "around the corner" is the minimum necessary information
> - Quality: there probably is a gas station
> - Relation: implies that you can get gas at gas station
> - Manner: Nothing unambiguous about this answer

**Why are segues important in conversations?**

Because of System 1â€™s priming tendencies or cognitive ease. It seems unnecessary but has unconscious benefits.
