Notes from [What is Phenomenology? The Philosophy of Husserl and Heidegger - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvA9FxsM9G8)

History of [[Phenomenology]]
- 18C Kant proposed, and briefly picked up by [[(Philosopher) G. W. F. Hegel|Hegel]]
- But only until [[(Philosopher) Edmund Husserl]] did it become mainstream
	- Student: [[(Philosopher) Martin Heidegger]]
- Germany → France
	- [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Jean-Paul Satre]]
- Modern philosophers: [[Michel Foucault]], [[Judith Butler]], [[Jacques Derrida]]

Defining Phenomenology
- Greek word for "Appears"
- Focus on the first hand experience
- experientialist > rationalist
- e.g. time
	- rationalist: measurement of numerical time
	- experientialist: subjective personal time
		- e.g. the "pretty girl minute"
- e.g. fear
	- rationalist: physiological change, observable behavior of beings in fear
	- experientialist: how fear colors perceptions, the conscious experience of fear

- Reversal of [[Plato]]
	- Most of philosophy until Husserl has been about following Plato
	- **Representational Theory**
		- Plato's Cave analogy(representational theory)
		- Humans have
		- It's a tragedy; our senses only allow incomplete access to reality
		- Peaked in Decartes' mind-body dualism

- Husserl's "**Transcendental Phenomenology**"
	- Objective study of the subjective
	- Theory of "Intentionality" = "about-ness"
		- Coined by Brentano (teacher)
		- consciousness cannot be isolated; it's always interacting with its subjects
		- study of how the _object of consciousness_ interacts with the _structure of consciousness_
	- whether the object is a fantasy/reality/dream/memory doesn't matter
	- Phenomenological method
		- **Bracketing**: setting aside judgements, filters, and gathering the raw experience;
		- **Eidetic reduction** ($\approx$imaginary variation): reduce to essence
			- Mess with the attributes of the phenomenon
			- e.g. Fear ⇒ attributes: lack of choice, freeze
		- End goal of phenomenology: getting to the _universal, objective understanding_ of the concept

- Heidegger disagrees: "**Existential Phenomenology**"
	- Husserl: trying to make a science of the consciousness
	- Heidegger's **ontological twist:**
		- the goal is instead understanding the nature of being
		- _experience_ and _consciousness_ cannot be separated
		- entanglement varies between people
		- e.g. fear of you, an animal, or an Aztec warrior is different

- Eastern connection (China, India)
	- e.g. Meridian system by China, Chakra by India
	- Looks stupid from rationalist perspective
	- ⇒ but it's the mapping of the first-person experience of the body
	- e.g. [[meditation]]: observe the experience
		- a form of bracketing (stopping judgement, and just experiencing thoughts and emotions)
		- Zen buddism
		- Daoism may have influenced Husserl directly too
