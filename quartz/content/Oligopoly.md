### Definitions
- **Best Response Curve**: A function that determines one’s _best response value_ of the strateigic variable, given the opponent’s strategic variable value.
	- This is equivalent to the _pure strategy function_ (see [definition](obsidian://advanced-uri?vault=Slipbox&block=hzlo35&uid=0090e3e1-1957-4e05-8935-7ce26a176987))
- $D^r$ denotes **residual demand** for one firm
### Assumptions
- Assume that products are identical [=no differentiation]
- Assume there are two firms in the market
- Assume that $MC$ is constant
### Types
- [[Bertrand Price Competition]]
	- Product Differentiation
- [[Cornout Quantity Competition]]
	- Sequential (=Stackleberg)

There are thus 2 ways to fill in the gap between 2-firm oligopoly and perfect compeition:

1. **N-firm Oligopoly** as an extension of Cornout’s 2-firm oligopoy analysis
2. **Monopolistic Competition**, where firms strategically set **differentiation** and **price**
