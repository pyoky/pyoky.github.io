- **Contract Curve** is the set of pareto efficient points in the edgeworth box.
	- Example. The black curve in (b) is the contract curve. ![[Screenshot 2023-10-24 at 15.31.35.png]]
	- The gradient of the two curves must be equal in every point of the contract curve.
	- The **Core** is the set of Pareto efficient allocations that make both parties better off than their endowments. (The highlighted section inside the green is the core.) ![[Screenshot 2023-10-24 at 15.34.46.png|260]]
- **Equilibrium** is when the exchange rate of goods (i.e. the price ratio) is set in such a way that trade occurs and there is market clearance (i.e. $Q_{\text{demand}}=Q_{\text{supply}}$).
	- It must be [[Pareto Efficiency|pareto efficient]].
	- Example of a Disequilibirum. Here. price is set to $1\text{ orange}=1~\text{banana}$. Blue player will move $E_{1}\to A$, and red $E_{2}\to B$. But those two points do not meet.![[Screenshot 2023-10-24 at 15.38.11.png]]
	- Example of Equilibirum. Here, price is set to $1.5~\text{orange}=1~\text{banana}$. Blue moves $E\to C$, and Pink moves $E\to C$ and therefore demand for bananas is equal to supply of bananas, and demand for oranges are equal to supply of oranges.![[Screenshot 2023-10-24 at 15.40.33.png]]
	- Solving for the equilibirum:
		1. Get the [[Uncompensated Demand curve|Ordinary Demand]] for good $x_{1}$ from both parties.
			- in this case, the [[Budget Lines|Budget Constraint]] is $I=p_{1}e_{1}+p_{2}e_{2}$
		2. Set the equilibirum condition $Q_\text{demand}=Q_\text{supply}$
			- $x_{1}^A+x_{1}^B=e_{1}^A+e_{1}^B$
			- $\text{Demand by A}+ \text{Demand by B}=\text{Endowment of A}+\text{Endowment of B}$
		3. Solving this for the price ratio $\frac{p_{1}}{p_{2}}$ will yield the relative price (=price that will lead to a trade that results in an equilibirum).
