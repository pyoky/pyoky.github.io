### Perfect Competition
Conditions:
1. Zero profit condition: $\pi=px-c(x)=0$
2. Pricing at marginal cost:
	1. ! only when $MC$ is constant…
	2. $p=MC$

3. [[Profit Function|Theory of the Firm]] but with…
	- Fixed costs, i.e. $\pi=px-wl-rk-FC$
	- Firms will enter and exit
		- ⇒ supply price and quantity is at $\pi=0$
	- → market price and individual firm's quantity supplied are determined by this formula.
	- This is equivalent to the minimum average cost condition $min_{x} AC(x)$.
4. [[Utility Maximization]] but…
	- Consider only one good, $x_{1}$
	- There are more than one consumers. $x_1^{\text{market demand}}=x_{1}\times \text{\# of consumers}$
5. Market equilibrium: ![[Pasted image 20231024162342.png]]
	- Price is set at $p^*$ because it is fully determined by the firm.
		- The quantity supplied changes by firms entering and exiting (not by individual firms ramping up or cutting down on production!)
	- Quantity demanded (=aggregate quantity supplied) of $x^*$ is fully determined by the consumer.
