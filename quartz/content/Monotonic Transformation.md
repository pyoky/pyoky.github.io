def. **Monotonic Transformation.** A transformation of a [[Utility Function]] is one that preserves the order of preferences of the original function. i.e., $f$ is a monotomic transformation of utility function $u(\vec{x})$ iff:

$$
\forall (\vec{x^A},\vec{x^B}) \text{, if }  u(\vec{x^A})>u(\vec{x^B}) \implies f \circ u(\vec{x^A})> f \circ u(\vec{x^B})
$$

Simple monotonic transformations:
- Adding or subtracting a constant
- Multiplying or dividing by a positive constant
- For always positive functions, exponentiation to a constant
- For always positive functions, logarithm to a constant base

thm. **monotonic transformation equivalence.** If one utility function is a monotonic transformation of another, you may treat it for all practical purposes as the same utility function.
