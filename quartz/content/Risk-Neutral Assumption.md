**Motivation.** A risk-neutral world is where there is no risk premium on return. This implies:
- All [[Present Value Calculations]] are done at the risk-free rate
- All assets have risk-free rate of return (=zero ri[[No-Arbitrage]]itrage Condition]] holds
- & This is not really realistic, but simplifies calculations a lot.

A risk-neutral measure is a probability measure such that $\mathbb{E}(S_{0})=e^{ rt }$, in other words, all securities have risk-free rate of return.
