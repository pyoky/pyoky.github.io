Manners are a cultural focal point in order to not have to do the emotional calculus of [[Empathy]]. It saves a lot of time especially for you, so use it well.
- [[Be Nice]]. When in doubt, be nice.
- [[Punctuality Principle]]. Make sure you're on time (but also don't be flaked on)
- [[Stagecraft]]. Being presentable is important
- [[Confidence]]. Since you have manners, you should be confident and have self-respect
- [[Noblesse Oblige]]. What you have, you must share (knowledge, money, etc.).
- [[Humor]]. A basic sense of humor makes other people at ease.
- [[Humility]]. Speak nicely and hold a big sword. Being humble will only increase the perception of your skills.
