## Long Run Input Demand

def. **Ordinary Input Demand.** [[Uncompensated Demand curve|Ordinary Demand]] for Inputs (=labor $l$, capital $k$)
- To derive: [[Profit Function#Profit Function]]
- Properties:
	1. HD0 in $(w,r,p)$
	2. Decreasing in own-price ‚Üêregardless of anything! (Unlike [[Utility Maximization]])

def. **Conditional Input Demand.** Demand of input (=labor $l$, capital $k$) in order to produce a certain level out output $\bar{x}$
- HOWTO get: [[Cost Minimization]]
- Properties
	1. HD0 in input prices $w,r$
	2. Decreasing in own-price

## Short Run Input Demand

Short run (own-price) labor demand: $l_{\bar{k}}(w,p|\bar{k})$
- $\bar{k}$ is a parameter. Set it as the long-run input demand $k(w,r,p)$.
- In the short run, a change in $w$ or $p$ will only operate within $l_{\bar{k}}$ with no change in $\bar{k}$ possible.
- In the long run, we simply calculate the long-run input demand $l(w,r,p)$.

## Long Run Output Supply

def. **Ordinary Supply**. Relates the prices of inputs and output with the quantity of output produced

$$
x:(w,r,p)\mapsto x
$$

Properties
1. HD0 in prices $w,r,p$
2. increasing in output price $x$
3. decreasing in input price $w,r,$

### (HowTo) Derive Supply Function
Method 1:
1. Get [[Input Demand and Output Supply]] from [[Profit Maximization for Perfect Competition|Profit Maximization]]
2. Substitute into the [[Production Function]] $x=f(l(w,r,p),k(w,r,p))$
3. Simplify to get $x(w,r,p)$.
Method 2:
4. Get cost function from [[Cost Minimization]]

## Short Run Output Supply

Short run (own-price) output supply: $x_{\bar{k}}(w,p|\bar{k})$
- $\bar{k}$ is a parameter. Set it to the long-run input demand $k(w,r,p)$
- Use the [[production function]] $x=f(l,k)$ but with $\bar{k}$ fixed.
- In the short run, a change in $w$ or $p$ will only operate within $x_{\bar{k}}$ with no change in $\bar{k}$ possible.
- In the long run, we simply calculate the long-run output demand $l(w,r,p)$.
