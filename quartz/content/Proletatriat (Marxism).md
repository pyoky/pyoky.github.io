## Defining the Proletatriat

Marx “calling into being” the class of the **proles**. The process of their organization organically produces the communist party as a political power.

> The proletariat goes through various stages of development. With its birth begins its struggle with the bourgeoisie

1. Disorganized proles
   Organized by BZ [=companies, etc.]

> At this stage, the labourers still form an incoherent mass scattered over the whole country, and broken up by their mutual competition

1. Organized Unions
   Separate, permanent unions to fight for wage

> Now and then the workers are victorious, but only for a time. The real fruit of their battles lies, not in the immediate result, but in the ever expanding union of the workers.

1. Nationally organized communist community

> It was just this contact that was needed to centralise the numerous local struggles, all of the same character, into one national struggle between classes.

1. Ultimately the formation of the communist party

> This organisation of the proletarians into a class, and, consequently into a political party

It is unfortunately for the bz that the proles—the class whose founding was caused by capital—will eventually be the ones to destroy them:

> But not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to itself; it has also called into existence the men who are to wield those weapons—the modern working class—the proletarians.

> What the bourgeoisie therefore produces, above all, are its own grave-diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable.
