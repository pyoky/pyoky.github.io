Factories ← → [[Proletatriat (Marxism)|Workers]] inversion/subject-object inversion, a moral indignation

- Humans as organs of the machine → machine **dominates, is the agent;** a quantity → qualitative change
  - Difference between tool and machine [= the factory]
- **trained since childhood** as functions of organs; transforms the person as an appendage

Effects on the human body/soul

- Deprives work of all content ← extended alienation, abstraction of labor

Revolts & Machines

- Machine → labor revolt → suppressed by machinery (labor is easily replacable, putting machine v. worker against each other)

> [!info] Machine ← is it literal “[[Industrial Revolution|industrial]] machine”, or is it more abstract “technological systems/organization systems”

- it is the system not the machine that is at fault. Less of the literal machines, more of the productivity advantage/disadvantage
