## Problem 4

Let agents 1 (Alice) and 2 (Bob). The optimal case is when $1$ gets $a$ and $2$ gets $b$ if $\alpha>\beta$, and vice versa, thus maximum welfare for efficient allocation is 
$$
\underbrace{ 2 }_\text{ by agent 2 }+\underbrace{ \text{max}(\alpha,\beta) }_\text{ by agent 1 }
$$


$1$ will demand both initially when $p_{a}=p_{b}=0$ but will drop out once
$$
\begin{align}
2-(p_{a}+p_{b}) & <\text{max}(\alpha-p_{a},\beta-p_{b}) \\
\end{align}
$$
Case $\alpha-p_{a}>\beta -p_{b}$. Then 
$$
\begin{align}
p_{a}+p_{b} & >2-\alpha+p_{a} \\
p_{b} & >2-\alpha & \text{as } 1<2-\alpha<2 \text{ since } \alpha \in (0,1)  \\
p_{b}& >1
\end{align}
$$
And $1$ will not demand $b$ anymore. This will lead to two cases:
- If $p_{a}<p_{b}$ auction continues since both chooses $a$. $1$ will drop out eventually, as $p_{a}$ will be raised until $p_{a}>\alpha$ while $2$ still demands $a$ as long. Total welfare is $2$. 
- If $p_{b}<p_{a}$ then $1$ will drop out, $2$ will get $b$ with total welfare $2$.
Same can be shown for $\alpha-p_{a}<\beta-p_{b}$.
