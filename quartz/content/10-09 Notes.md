- Building:
	- #Computing as a method of building the mechanized world
	- #Economics as the elegant dance of these emergently rational parts
	- #Literature as the observation, the [[Phenomenology|phenomelogical]] stance of taking the grand experience in its entirety (Oh me! oh life!)
	- Physics as the futile goal of a bygone era of human excellence, humanism that trumped it all, that rationality could conquer the forces of all [[emergent phenomena]]. And we couldn't.

	- #sociability and #Sociability/Dating as a construction of a [[Communication]] channel between humans
		- [[Communication]] is humanity's resolution with [[Solipcism]]. [[Solipcism|Fundamental Misunderstanding]] can be resolved through [[Communication]]
	- Your brain as a linear machine that cannot inherently focus on the graph, the whole picture in a visual, direct way but only in an intuitive way.
- Methodollogical issues
	- The importance of being purely [[Honesty|honest]] with your own emotions
