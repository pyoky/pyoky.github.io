- Establishing causality
	- does "policy/behavior/program → outcome"?
	- $X \to Y$?
- Challenges
	1. Is it random noise?
		- Removing outliers
	2. Are there exogenous factors?
		- - $X$ is endogenous if $X$ correlates with $\epsilon$ (error)—==non-causal==, lurking variable
		- - $X$ is exogenous if $X$ doesn't correlation with $\epsilon$—==likely causal==
- Regression Analysis: $Y_{i}= \beta_{0}+\beta_{1}X_{i}+\epsilon_{i}$
	- $\beta_{0}$: intercept. Less interesting
	- $\beta_{1}$: slope. More Interesting
	- $X$: independent variable
	- $Y$: dependeng variable
- ! be careful…
	- Correlation $\neq$ Causation
	- A higher slope doesn't mean higher correlation; a higher [[Correlation]] coefficient ($\rho=\frac{\sigma _{XY}}{\sigma_{X}\sigma_{Y}}$) does mean higher correlation.
	- Statistical Significance $\neq$ Real-life Effects
