\begin{align}

x&=f(l,k) & \text{Long Run}
\end{align}

## Terminology

def. **Marginal Product**. The additional output in units of good $x$ giving additional input (labor or capital)
$$

MP_{l}=\frac{df}{dl},MP_{k}=\frac{df}{dk}

$$

def. **Marginal Revenue Product**. The additional output in units of dollars ($) given one unit of additional input (labor or capital)

def. **Law of Diminishing Marginal Product.** As the input increases over a certain point, the marginal product of the input decreases. This happens for both labour and capital in production functions.
- Mathematically, There exists some $l^*$ such that:
$$

\frac{\partial MP_{l}}{\partial l}\Big|_{l^*}<0

$$

## Returns to Scale

Production functions are one of three types:
1. Decreasing Returns to scale: $tf(l,k)<f(tl,tk)$
2. Constant Returns to scale: $tf(l,k)=f(tl,tk)$
3. Increasing Returns to scale: $tf(l,k)>f(tl,tk)$

## Micro Production Function

### Short Run

def. **SR Production function**. $f(l,k)$ where $l$ denotes labor input, and $k$ denotes capital input. Range is the units of output good.

- Short Run (SR) is defined as the timeframe where $l$ can be varied, but $k$ is fixed.
- Also known as _production frontiers_ or _producer choice sets_.
- While production frontiers can take on any shape, the most common shape is that of (b) (due to Law of diminishing marginal product).

def. **SR Marginal Product of Labor** ($\text{MP}_l$) The marginal change in output with a unit more of labor.
- In the short-run production function, that is the gradient of the function, i.e. $\text{MP}_l=\frac{df}{dl}$.
