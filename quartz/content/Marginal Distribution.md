## Discrete Marginal Distribution

def. **Marginal Distributions** are used when you only have the joint distribution available, and you want to get the distribution of one of the variables. They’re called that because you can write them in the margins.

## Joint Marginal Distribution

def. **Marginal Distribution** of Continuous [[Joint Distributions]]. Let $X,Y$ and given $f_{X,Y}$. Then PDF of $X$ is:

$$
f_{X}(\bar x)=\int_{y=-\infty}^\infty
f_{X,Y}(\bar x,y) \,dy
$$

…and vice versa for $f_Y$.
