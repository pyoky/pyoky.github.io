We no longer live in a world that is understandable through the natural way of things. ([[Jean Baudrillard]])
- The [[Emergent Phenomena]] our societies have [[Constructed World|constructed]], from [[Society's Scripts|Gender Roles]] to [[Ask vs. Guess Culture]], [[Social Media]] is far removed from our nature as human beings or our nature of what it means to be a social creature.
- â‡’ It's past the tipping point of being connected to the "real", thus Baudrillard's Hyperreality
- The naturalism argument no longer holds
- "It's the way it's always been" no longer holds ground

Instead of invoking hyperreality as something to be afraid of, embrace it.
- [[Living With the Internet]]
- [[The Personal Computer]]
- [[Tools and Structures Define Your Capacity]]
- [[Pride]], and [[Gender is a performance]]
