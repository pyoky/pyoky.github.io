> Much behavior is not reinforced every time it is emitted, and **the pattern of intermittent reinforcement strongly affects** how fast an operant response is learned, what its rate is at any given time, and how long it continues when reinforcement ceases. The simplest rules controlling reinforcement are **continuous reinforcement**, where every response is reinforced, and **extinction**, where no response is reinforced. Between these extremes, more complex **"schedules of reinforcement"** specify the rules that determine how and when a response will be followed by a reinforcer.
