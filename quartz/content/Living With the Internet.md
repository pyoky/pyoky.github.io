## Principles

> [!quote] Digital Minimalism

- Critical Information Consumption
	- [To navigate the dangers of the web, you need critical thinking – but also critical ignoring](x-devonthink-item://E3D23013-9A29-4F1E-8080-36854B936B84)
- [[Attention is Currency]]
	- Modern society, wrote Simon, faces a challenge: to learn to “allocate attention efficiently among the overabundance of sources that might consume it.”
		- Attention is the _currency of the modern internet businesses_.
		- Corporate internet tries to entice you with your attention. (there is a distinction between corporate internet and grassroots internet.)
	- Beware [[Highly Sensitive Person (HSP)|Overstimulation]]. Give attention to what matters only.
		- Use the [[Stream of Content]]—pick out only what you find nutritious, and ignore the rest.

	- [[Negative Emotions are Not Helpful]].
- Solution: [[Nudging]]
	- Build in friction to reduce the chances of you giving into attention-sucking content or outrage content
