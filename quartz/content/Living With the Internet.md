## Problems

> [!quote] Digital Minimalism

- **Minimize online disagreements.** [Kurzgesagt—Internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuFlMtZmvY0) While traditionally disagreement and debate is viewed positively, this is not true online. ^1840c9
	- Offline, there are ways to ameliorate hard feelings through [[Manners]] and ettiquete, such as sports players bowing after a game. Online, there is no way of connecting with the other person after disagreement.
	- Algorithms exacerbate this by optimizing for engagement, and outrage is particularly effective in this. [Though Germs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc) by [[CGP Grey]]
	- [[Negative Emotions are Not Helpful]].
- **[[Attention is Currency]]**
	- Modern society, wrote Simon, faces a challenge: to learn to “allocate attention efficiently among the overabundance of sources that might consume it.”
		- Attention is the _currency of the modern internet businesses_.
		- Corporate internet tries to entice you with your attention. (there is a distinction between corporate internet and grassroots internet.)
	- Beware [[Highly Sensitive Person (HSP)|Overstimulation]]. Give attention to what matters only.
		- Use the [[Stream of Content]]—pick out only what you find nutritious, and ignore the rest.

## Solutions

- [[Nudging]]. Built-in friction to reduce the chances of you giving into attention-sucking content or outrage content. The first line of defense.
- **Prioritise the small internet.** This means engaging in communities where you share the same interests, opinions. Often, they come with rules and guidelines of behavior.
- Use [[Action Queue]]s to browse the internet. This encourages you to _think before you consume_ (also helps w.r.t. [[Importance of Inputs]]).
- Use the sources from [[Personal Culture]]. This means using human curated sources (either by yourself or others) as the starting point of online life. Do not use algorithmically curated sources.
