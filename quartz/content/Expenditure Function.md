def. **Expenditure Function.** ($\approx$Income Function) Relates prices and a certain utility to the required income to achieve that level of utility.

$$
E:(p_{1},p_{2},\bar{u})\mapsto I
$$

<u>Derivation</u>. Substitute [[Marginal Willingness to Pay|Hicksian Demand functions]] into the [[Budget Lines|Budget Constraint]].

<u>Properties</u>.
- [[Homogenous Function|HD1]] in prices ($E({\color{red}t}p1,{\color{red}t}p_{2},\bar{u})={\color{red}t}E(p_{1},p_{2},\bar{u})$)
- Increasing in prices ($\frac{\partial E}{\partial p_{1}},\frac{\partial E}{\partial p_{2}}\geq 0$)
	- _equal_ when you're not buying that good.
	- Higher prices require more income
- Increasing in utility ($\frac{\partial E}{\partial u}>0$)
	- More utility requires more expenditure.
- Use [[Shepard's Lemma]] in order to get back to [[Marginal Willingness to Pay|Hicksian Demand Curve]]
