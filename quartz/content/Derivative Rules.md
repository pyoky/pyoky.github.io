## Derivation Rules

Chain Rule:

$$
y=g(u)\implies u=f(g(x))\implies \frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dy}{du}\cdot \frac{du}{dx}
$$

$$
f(g(x))=f'(g(x))\cdot g'(x)
$$

Product Rule:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}f(x)g(x)=f'(x)g(x)+f(x)g'(x)
$$

Filliping:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx}=(\frac{dx}{dy})^{-1}
$$

$$

$$

## Special Functions

### Exponentials

- $f(x) = a^x$ then $f'(x) = \ln(a) \cdot a^x$
- $f(x) = e^x$ then $f'(x) = e^x$
- $f(x) = a^{g(x)}$ then $f'(x) = \ln(a) \cdot a^{g(x)} \cdot g'(x)$
- $f(x) = e^{g(x)}$ then $f'(x) = e^{g(x)} \cdot g'(x)$

1. Functions and cofunctions are on horizontal lines.
2. Derivatives of functions on the right have a negative sign; those on the left do not.
3. Functions and reciprocals are on diagonal lines.
	1. e.g. $\sin(x)=\frac{1}{\csc(x)}$
4. Each function is the ratio of the next two functions clockwise.
	1. e.g. $\tan(x)=\frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}$
5. Each function the the product of its two neighbors.
6. The two functions at the top are bounded. The rest are unbounded.
7. The functions that are vertices of a triangle with a Roman numeral inside are related by Pythagorean identities.
	1. e.g. $\sin(x)^2+\cos(x)^2=1$

Function | Derivative | Integral
--- | --- | ---
$\sin(x)$ | $\cos(x)$ | $-\cos(x) + C$
$\cos(x)$ | $-\sin(x)$ | $\sin(x) + C$
$\tan(x)$ | $\sec^2(x)$ | $-\ln |\cos(x)| + C$
$\cot(x)$ | $-\csc^2(x)$ | $\ln |\sin(x)| + C$
$\sec(x)$ | $\sec(x) \tan(x)$ | $\ln |\sec(x) + \tan(x)| + C$
$\csc(x)$ | $-\csc(x) \cot(x)$ | $\ln |\csc(x) + \cot(x)| + C$
