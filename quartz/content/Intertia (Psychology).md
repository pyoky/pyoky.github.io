> [!info] You must do uncomfortable things. One of the most uncomfortable things in life is practicing something you’re bad at.

시작이 반이다 suggests one of the biggest hurdle is starting the project. You're breaking open a new field, and by doing so you get used to doing the project. It's the establishment of a **new identity habit** and routine.

Following through with the effort of keeping the habit maintained and the porject open is the role of Habits and Routines. But groundbreaking comes before maintenance. So don't hesitate to break open a field when there are available resources (i.e. time and willpower). Starting a project earlier will bring the finale that much closer. The regret is usually, "I should've begun earlier."

Remember polymath: to be good at art you need to be smiling at your own garbage until you get better.

Momentum is a closely-related theory that explains how it's exponentially easier to continue even a difficult task than to break ground (e.g. dull physics report calculations can be done with little relative distress, but starting the work with those calculations is a big burden.)

Also see how [[Get Lost in the Weeds]] and compounding interest with momentum allows for great efficiencies and achievements.

When rebuilding momentum due to a distraction, an environment transition, or [[Depressive Episodes]], you should not time track. This distracts from actually focussing on the task. It removes the “case-study” mindset and frames the mind in a productivity oriented, quantity based unhelpful mindset.

It gets easier and easier as you start rolling the ball.
