## How Bonds Work

![Cash Flow Structure of a Bond.|300](Untitled%2018.png)

- Lender lends money to the government (usually US [[Treasury]])
- **Coupon payments** pay regularly:
	- Semi-annually for US Treasury
	- Annually for other countries
- **Principal** (=par, base) amount is paid at the **maturity;**
- **Time To Maturity** (TTM) is time from now to when the principal pays
- **Yield**
	- Current Yield
	- Yield to Maturity: Expectation Hypothesis defines **yield to maturity** as the **expected rate of return** _if held til maturity._

### Cash Flow Structure of a Bond

Governments are the borrowers of money in this transaction.

- Government “issues” bonds regularly, which is
	- Primary Market: [[Treasury]] sells bonds (millions of $ worth) mostly to private [[Investment Bank]]s
	- Secondary Market: Investment banks sell smaller chunks to private investors / bond holders sell to each other![Untitled|340](Untitled%201%209.png)
- Governments pay coupon and principal through
	1. Tax revenue
	2. Issuing more bonds![Untitled|380](Untitled%202%206.png)

Bonds are an important part of a portfolio because…
- Are near-riskless investments as they generate stable cash flows. The only risks are:
  inflation risk—when the government doesn’t have the money, they’ll just print more money. This causes inflation which devalues the bonds.
- Are very liquid, since many people are willing to buy bonds in most scenarios, even in recessions.
