Hyperreality is a society in which everything is a [[Social Construct]] and there is little or no ties to the underlying reality.
- [[Humanism]]
- Computer Science and Economics is the study of truths and construction of the constructed world.
- **Deconstruction Fallacy:** Assuming something is not [[Reliable, Replicable and Scalable]] because it builds on the constructed world
	- e.g. "Using this medicine that I have to use forever is not reliable because it doesn't work if I can't afford it or live in a place where it's inaccessible"
	- e.g. "This program is unreliable because it connects to the internet"
	- â‡’ It is a fallacy because human society is always built; the "natural" thing doesn't exist. We're all [[Living in Hyper-Reality]].
