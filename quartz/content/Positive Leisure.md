Leisure in economics is simply "not working." Instead, I define positive leisure as:
def. Positive Leisure. Positive leisure means two things:
1. **[[(Youtube) Spaceship You|Creating]] at Leisure.** You're doing "work" that benefits you/others. [[CGP Grey]] definition
2. **Leisurely Pace.** Making sure life is not rushed, and there is space.
3. **Uneconomic Leisure.** Leisure that is not about consumption (i.e. buying things/spending money).

> [!hint] Leisure is about making sure you're life is full of "doing things at your leisure," or going through life at a "leisurely pace."

Positive leisure understands...
- ...that resting in the modern world means *mental*, not physical relaxation
- ...that leisure is [[Positive Leisure|derived from structure]]
- ...that not doing anything may also be draining

Positive leisure implements the following:
- Do things at your leisure (=do things as slowly as you want.)
	- Most things can stand being done later
	- [[理(ことわり)|Sometimes you have to not give a shit]]
	- You're not rushing because you need to, you're rushing because society pressures you to.
	- **Forcibly Slow Down, Set a Very Long Time Slot, etc.** Using deliberate slowing down as a strategy for managing stress or overwhelming situations.
- Productivity #Logistics/Productivity is not against leisure. In fact, productivity is about doing things well and at your leisure.
	- Move between tasks at a leisurely pace
	- When you do this, you have more [[Slack]].
	- Procrastination happens when you fail to combine productivity and leisure well.
- [[감성]] cannot exist without emotional peace.
	- Even in turmoil you can have emotional peace, and time to reflect on those feelings.
	- [[성민석]] says 감성 is what makes life worth living. And it is for you too.
- Positive leisure often leads to [[Gratitude]]
	- It's easier to enjoy the things (=physical things & immaterial things) you already have.

## Creating Positive Leisure

- [[Well-Timed Breaks|Breathe]]
- Moving slowly through life
- If you have too much things to do, either…
	- …remove the offender
	- …increase productivity (get the simple things done fast)

## Structured Relaxation (=Leisurely Relaxation)

Find Leisure that either:
1. Relaxes you fully
	- Sleep, Music, Movie
	- Relaxing on a couch doing nothing
2. You feel good having done it
	- Reading a book or magazine article
	- [[Importance of Inputs|New content]], e.g. on Netflix, subscribed Youtubers, Mastodon, etc.
		- → These should be your own curation, from people/sources you've chosen

<u>Fun and Pleasure is derived from Structure</u>
- Pleasure and pain is derived not from absolutes \[=it isn't a sliding scale from pleasure to pain] but is an [[Emergent Phenomena]] from structures in life.
	- [Hedonistic Adaptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill) and the reverse for pain evidences this.
- Structure is essential, and doesn't harm pleasure. It more often actually enhances it.
	- [[Hedonism|spice and honey]] is enhanced at duke, as Celine does.
	- [[(Book) How to Be Miserable - Randy J Paterson]]: taking part in "hedonism" is ineffective because impulses!= what's good for you. "Those who eschew impulses are better hedonists than you are."
- This is fotunate, because this means that [[Creation Station]] is not mutually exclusive from pleasure. To achieve both, aim to maintain separation between locations.

## Flow Work

- **Happiness Through Achieving the State of 'Flow':** Seeking happiness in the immersion and engagement of tasks.
