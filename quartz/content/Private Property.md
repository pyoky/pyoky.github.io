> the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of private property

> But does wage-labour create any property for the [[Proletatriat (Marxism)|labourer]]? Not a bit. It creates capital, i.e., that kind of property which exploits wage-labour, and which cannot increase except upon condition of begetting a new supply of wage-labour for fresh exploitation

> When, therefore, capital is converted into common property, into the property of all members of society, personal property is not thereby transformed into social property. It is only the social character of the property that is changed. It loses its class character.

> Finally, communism2 is the positive expression of the abolition of private property and at first appears as universal private property.
