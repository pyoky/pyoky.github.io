**The most significant thing about technological improvement is equality**.
Nobody cares if you are or aren’t from a noble family; if you have money it’s fine.
- Think—_pride and prejudice_ society was rejecting those who have gained prestige with just money.
- Think also: discussion with mom, when she says “technological improvement is irrelevant; where there are people, there is love and relationship.” Only those who are lucky enough to be born in the modern age has that prestige of emotion, etc. Also think: the hindsight paradox.
