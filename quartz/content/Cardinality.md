def. $\beth_{0}$ is the cardinality of natural numbers
def. $\beth_{1}$ is the cardinality of real numbers

- $\beth_{n+1}=2^{\beth_{n}}$ i.e. $\beth_{n+1}$ is the cardinality of all the subsets of $\beth_{n}$

## Continuum Hypothesis

hyp. There is no set whose cardinality is between that of integers and real numbers.
- Expressed using above notation: $\beth_{1}\overset{?}=\aleph_{1}$
- This hypothesis is proved to be unprovable within [[Zermelo-Frankle Set Theory with Axiom of Choice (ZFC)|ZFC]], according to [[Limits of Math and Computing]]
