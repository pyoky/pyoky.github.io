hyp. *A Social institution is defined by the rules that govern it*. (=it is a descriptive definition, not a constructive definition)
- US is defined by the Constitution & laws
The maintenance of a social institution is done by a stable equilibrium where everybody upholds the law and sanctifies it, and nobody dares to deviate.
- The president swears to uphold the constitution, not govern well.
- When conflict arises people look at the constitution debate about the law, not debate each other.
