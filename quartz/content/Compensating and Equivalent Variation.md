Q. **Coupon Exchange Problem.** Josh and Andrew have identical utility functions $u(x_{1},x_{2})$ where $x_{1}$ is milkshakes and $x_{2}$ is toys.
- Their incomes are the same
- Josh has a 50% off coupon for $x_{1}$.
- â‡’ Can Josh and Andrew work out a trade where Andrew buys the coupon?
<u>Figure out</u>
- Least Josh would take for the coupon using the expenditure function
- Most Andrew would pay for the coupon (also using the expenditure function)
- â‡’ Trade occurs when (least Josh would sell for) < (most Andrew would pay for)

> Oh no! the price of good $x_{1}$ increased!
> - ðŸ¥º She's now at a lower [[Utility Function|Indifference Curve]]. How much should we give as compensation to get her back on the _original_ indifference curve? â‡’ **Compensating Variation**
> - ðŸ˜ˆ She's at a _lower_ indifference curve now. What if instead of having the price of good $x_{1}$ increase, we just take money away from her directly? â‡’ **Equivalent Variation**

def. **Compensating Variation (CV)**. When a price of a good changes, the Compensating variation is the change in expenditure ($\pm$) required to maintain the utility.

def. **Equivalent Variation (EV**). An individual may trade a change in income ($\pm$) for a change in prices.

Compensating Variation (CV) is how much money an individual would have to get (or have taken away) to be indifferent to the change in prices
