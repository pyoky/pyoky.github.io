## “Crude” Communism

> The first positive abolition of private property - crude com­ munism - is therefore only a manifestation of the viieness of private property trying to establish itself as the positive com­ munity.

> Physical, immediate possession is the only purpose of life and existence as far as this communism is concerned; the category of worker is not abolished but extended to all men […] The crude communist is merely the culmination of this envy and desire to level down on the basis of a preconceived minimum. It has a definite, limited measure.

> (2) Communism (a) still of a political nature, democratic or despotic; (b) with the abolition of the state, but still essentially incomplete and influenced by private property, i.e. by the estrange­ ment of man.

## Actual Communism

> Communism is the _positive_ supersession of [[Private Property]] as human self-estrangement, and hence the true appropriation of the human essence through and for man

> it is the.genuine resolution of the conflict between man and nature, and between man and man, the true resolution of the conflict between existence and being, between objectification and self-affirmation, between freedom and necessity, between individual and species. It is the solution of the riddle of history and knows itself to be the solution.

and thus

> If we characterize communism itself - which because of its character as negation of the negation, as appropriation of the human essence which is mediated with itself through the negation of private property
