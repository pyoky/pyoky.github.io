## Microeconomics Assumptions

def. **Rational Preference**. Consider two basket of goods $A,B$. A rational preference is one that is all of the following:
1. **Complete**: either $A \succ B, B \succ A, \text{or } A\sim B$
	1. Comparable: You have to choose either of the above three
2. **Transitive**: $\text{if } A\succ B \text{ and } B\succ C \text{, then } A\succ C$
3. **Monotonic**: ${x_{1}}\succeq{x_2}$

The following are optional conditions
- **Convexity**: Averages are bette than extremes. (Preference of variety)

- The rational preference assumption and the convexity assumption will together be enough to define an [[Utility Function]].
- Two tastes are same if they have the same utility function, or the utility functions are [[Monotonic Transformation]]s of one another.
### Notation
- $A\sim B$: A is equally preferable with B
- $A\succ B$: A is strictly preferred to B
- $A\succsim B$: A is equally or more preferable to B
- $A \sim B$: A is equally preferred to B (**indifferent**)

def. **Homothetic Tastes**. Two equivalent definitions
1. Tastes are homothetic if the utility function (or its [[Monotonic Transformation]]) is [[HD]] of degree $k>0$
2. Tastes are homothetic if the [[Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS)|MRS]] depends only on $\frac{x_{2}}{x_{1}}$

$$
\begin{align}
&u(x_{1},x_{2}) \text{ is homogenous of degree } k \\
&\implies u({\color{red}t}x_{1},{\color{red}t}x_{2})=t^ku(x_{1},x_{2})
\end{align}
