**Comps Analysis**:= comparing companies with multiples.

> [!info] Higher EBITDA Multiple = Higher P/E = **More growth potential** = Better.

But make sure that the companies being compared are **similar in size/industry/geographic regions.**

## Multiples Analysis

$\coloneqq$ using the ratios of [[Income Statement|accounting line items]] (like EBITDA, income, etc.) to evaluate the **potential growth** of a firm.

- Ratios are calculated from estimations of future balance sheet line items.
- We use **rate of return** to compare investments, not price. $r=\frac{P_2-P_1}{P_1}$. You can't compare price.

The following are commonly used multiples:

- [[EBITDA Multiple]]
- [[Price to Earnings Ratio]]

## Accounting Sheets

- [[Balance Sheet]]
- [[Income Statement]]
- [[Free Cashflow]]
