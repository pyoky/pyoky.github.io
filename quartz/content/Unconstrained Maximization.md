1. The **first-order necessary condition** for a maximum or minimum. If a function has a maximum or minimum at a certain point, then its [[Critical Point|derivative at that point is zero]]
	- If $f(x)$ has a maximum or minimum at $x=c$, then $f'(c) = 0$.

2. The **second-order necessary condition** for a maximum. If a function has a maximum at a certain point, then its second derivative at that point is less than or equal to zero:
	- If $f(x)$ has a maximum at $x=c$, then $f''(c) \leq 0$.

3. The **second-order sufficient condition** for a maximum. If a function's first derivative is zero at a certain point and its second derivative at that point is less than zero, then the function has a maximum at that point:
    - If $f'(c) = 0$ and $f''(c) < 0$, then $f(x)$ has a maximum at x=c.

4. To find the **unconstrained maximum** of a function, we can set its derivative equal to zero and solve for 'x'. Then, we use the second derivative test to determine whether each solution is a maximum or minimum.
    - Find unconstrained maximum of $f(x)$
	    - set $f'(x) = 0$ and solve for 'x'.
	    - Use $f''(x)$ to verify maxima.
