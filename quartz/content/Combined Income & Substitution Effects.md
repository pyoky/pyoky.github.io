## Combined Income/Substitution Effects

_In cases where price of one good changes, income and substitution effects happen together._ Imagine when gasoline prices rise:

- **Graph (a)** shows the change in the budget line due to the increase in price of gasoline.
- **Graph (b)** shows the compensated budget line to maintain the level of utility.
- **Graph (c)** shows the ultimate, uncompensated bundle C.

The process for both effect is as follows

1. Move along the same utility curve from bundle A → B; **substitution effect**
2. Move to the new budget line from bundle B → C; **income effect**
   → this determines if good is normal (homo-thetic or not), quasi-linear, inferior; see below)

### Income and Substitution Effects on Types of Goods

The above case was when gasoline was a normal good. When gasoline is inferior the move due to income effect (B → C) is to the right. The degree to which this occurs coincidentally determines if the good is regular inferior, or (the strange case of) a Giffen good.

Observe that for both graphs B → C is a rightward move, because lowering income (blue → red) increased consumption, meaning this is an inferior good. If C has more of gasoline than A, it is the strange Giffen good.

### Bringing it Together

The final is combining all of these movements together. In the following graph, the consumer consumes only shirts and pants. Then they’re given a coupon that discounts the price of shirts (blue → red). Using the compensated budget we determine the substitution effect (b, A → B). Then, depending on whether shirts/pants are normal, inferior (or quasilinear) we can determine where the final income effect (B → C) will lie.

### Mathematically…

Assume:

- Utility curve $u_A=u(x_1,x_2)$
- Budget line $I=p_1x_1+p_2x_2$
- Your bundle $A(x_1^A,x_2^A)$,

Then occurs a change in price $p_1 \rightarrow p_1'$, causing a change in the budget line from $I \rightarrow I'$. Then, consider how much you should compensate your income, to stay in the same indifference curve with utility $u_A$. That is, _what is the minimum income that I can spend to reach a certain indifference curve?_

$\text{min }\,p_1'x_1+p_2x_2\, \text{ s.t.}\,\, u_A=u(x_1,x_2)$

Thus you find the bundle $B(x_1^B,x_2^B)$, with the size of the substitution effect $x_1^A →x_1^B$

Since this compensated budget is a hypothetical scenario, we will need to move back to the original budget.

$\text{max }\,u(x_1,x_2)\, \text{ s.t.}\,\, I'=p_1'x_1+p_2x_2$

to find bundle $C(x_1^C,x_2^C)$.
