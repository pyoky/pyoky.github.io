Collective Memory is a shared understanding of the past events of a [[Social Organization]] or [[Social Institution]].
- Collective memory serves to "get people on the same page" about the past. (For getting people on the same page about the present, we use [[Meetings as a Realization of Social Organization|Meetings (Sociology)]].)
