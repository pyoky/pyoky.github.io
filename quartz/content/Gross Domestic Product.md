GDP can be calculated by the following three methods:

## GDP

Defined equivalently in 3 ways:

$$
\begin{align}
\text{GDP}=Y&=f(l,k)\\
&= I_l + I_k + \pi
+ \text{tax}\\
&=C+I+G_\text{deficit}+NE
\end{align}
$$

- (1) uses the production function $f(l,k)$ against the whole economy
- (2) uses the Income method
- (3) uses the Output method. Generally, $C>G>I>NE$.
  - Consumption is stable in recessions because you need to eat; Investment suffers
  - Government spending composes around $1/3$ in US, $1/2$ is EU
  - Note that $NE-\text{Export}-\text{Imports}$ and thus Net Exports can be negative.

```ad-tip
üìé Observee (2) and (3) are same because the macroeconomic circular flow is a closed loop.

- Historically, the LR trend of GDP has been **growing exponentially** since the industrial revolution‚Ä¶
  - ‚Ä¶GDP per capita [‚Üêa better measure of well-being] is growing too‚Ä¶
  - ‚Ä¶Consumption per capita [‚Üêan even better measure of well-being] is growing too!
  - This growth seems to be coming from growth in **labor income**, while capital income is stagnant.
- Short-run fluctuations in GDP are due to the **business cycle.**
- Some economic activity is not in GDP:
  - Informal market (big in some countries; e.g. 1/3 in Brazil)
  - Home production; i.e. homemaking

## Calculation Methods

1. Output [= production] method
   $\begin{aligned}
Y&=\text{VA}_1+\text{VA}_2+\cdots\\
&=(P_1)+(P_2-P1)+\cdots
\end{aligned}$

2. Expenditure method:
   $Y=C+I+G+NX$
   ‚Üí $C$ is only for **final sales**, not for intermediate goods. Final sales are always to the household.
3. Income method
   $Y=I_K+I_N+\pi +t$
   ‚Üí Note that firms pass on their taxes to the consumer (HH), or corporate taxes are paid by entrepreneurs who are at the end of the day HHs.

### GNI [= GNP]

- GNI method
  $Y^D=I_K^D+I_N^D+\pi+t$
  ‚Ä¶$t$ if both incomes are pre-tax incomes
- GNP method
  $Y^D=C+I+G+NX+NI$
  ‚Ä¶where $NI$ is the net domestic income (inflow - outflow)

## Deflator & CPI

1. Deflator is the reduction of nominal GDP in years after the base year due to inflation.

   
$$
   \text{Deflator}=\frac{Y^\text{Nominal}}{Y^\text{Real}} \cdot100




   
$$

   ‚Ä¶thus the real gdp for year $i$ is calculated $Y^R_i=\frac{Y_i^N}{\text{Deflator}_i}\cdot 100$

   - Deflator is 100 in the base year
   - Deflator $\propto$ inflation rate

2. CPI is another index to reduce the nominal GDP. Assume the current year is $i$, base year $b$

   
$$
   \begin{aligned}
   \text{CPI}^\text{current}&=\frac{\sum p^\text{current}q^\text{base}}{\sum p^\text{base}q^\text{base}}\cdot100\\[1.5em]
   &=\frac{Y_\text{of base}^\text{in current dollars}}{Y_\text{of base}^\text{in current dollars}}\cdot 100
   \end{aligned}






   
$$

   ‚Ä¶thus the real gdp for year $i$ is calculated $Y_i^\text{Real}=\frac{Y_i^\text{Nominal}}{\text{CPI}_i}\cdot 100$
