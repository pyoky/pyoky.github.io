## Term Definitions

- **[[Instructions (Computer Science)|Instruction]]**: a single operation a processor can perform
- [[Instruction Set]]
- **Architecture**: An abstract specification of a computer’s hardware—an _interface_—in order to be able to write software for it. (a contract between HW and SW to interact)
- **Micro-architecture**: the actual implementation of the architecture design
- **Computer**: machine that follows simple instructions deterministically

> [!info] The design of the computer architecture will be influenced by: available **technology** of the time, programming **language** design, **operating system** design, the **applications** to write, and the **history** of the architecture design.

OSes and languages may also be influenced by the design of the architecture

## C Programming Language

**Unix** invented by: **Ken Thompson**

**C language** by: **Dennis Ritche**

(Think of it as: Newton, to create a new branch of science—**physics**—, invented **calculus** to make it possible.)

> [!info] The contraints of technology of the time shaped the design of C.

Limitations of: compiler size / code size / performance / portability

→ became a _portable assembly language_

Didn’t consider: security / robustness / maintainability / legacy code
