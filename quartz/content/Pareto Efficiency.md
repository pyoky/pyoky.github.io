**Pareto Efficiency** is a state where you cannot make one person [[Utility|better off]] without making another person worse off.
We will define pareto efficiency when there are $n$ divisible items and $n$ agents.

def. **Pareto Efficiency.** Allocation $\vec{x_{1}},\dots,\vec{x_{n}}$ is pareto efficiet where there exists *no* alternative allocation $\vec{y_{1}},\dots,\vec{y_{n}}$ such that both:
$$
\begin{align}
 & \exists i^{*} \text{ s.t. }  & \vec{y_{i^{*}}} \succeq_{i^{*}} \vec{x_{i^{*}}}  & \text{ one agent benefits}\\
 & \forall i,  & \vec{y_{i}} \succeq_{i}x_{x} & \text{others still not worse}
\end{align}
$$
