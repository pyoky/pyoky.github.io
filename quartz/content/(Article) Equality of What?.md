[(DevonThink) Sen,Equality](x-devonthink-item://A39C35A3-334A-4C68-B441-ABAED64D026B)

- Equity is about asking "what should be equal?"
	- Libertarians: Equality of Rights
	- [[utilitarianism|Utilitarians]]: Equal Weighting of [[Utility]]
	- Progressive Taxation: Equality of Need Satisfaction
	- etc.
- ⇒ The question then becomes: "Equality of What?"
	- Pursuit of equality in one domain often damages another domain
		- ⇒ arguments are often in the form of "Inequality in space A is acceptable, because it increases equality in space B."
	- Common framing is between equality and liberty
		- e.g. left: equality in needs. right: liberty and freedom
		- This is the wrong framing because there are lots of other candidates anyways
- Alternative framing: [[Efficiency (Statistics)]]
	- Efficiency of utility ⇒ [[Microeconomics|Pareto Optimum]]
	- Efficiency of liberty ⇒ Libertarian Government
	- etc.
