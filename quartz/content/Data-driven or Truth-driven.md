Data-Algorithm structure in the top-down approach; Truth-Proof in the bottom-up approach.
- They merge at Godel's Incompleteness Theorem
	- [Relation between GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem, the halting problem and universal Turing machines - Computer Science Stack Exchange](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/419/is-there-any-concrete-relation-between-g%C3%B6dels-incompleteness-theorem-the-halti)
	- [[Limits of Math and Computing]].
	- Think: the [[Turing Machine#Universal Turing Machine|UTM]] takes a binary encoding of a TM and can simulate that TM. This is algorithm that is taken as input data to another algorithm.
- Axioms are fundamental bits of data. Using proofs we derive more data \[=conjectures, theorems].

## Data-Algorithm
[[Phenomenology]] and to a greater extent whole of Continental Philosophy. [[Data is Everything]]. [[Perspective Projections Model]]

## Truth-Proof
Bertrand Russell, G. E. Moore and all of [[Analytic Philosophy]]
