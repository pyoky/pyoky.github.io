Scheduling problem solution formulations
1. Sort by some quantity
2. Schedule accordingly
3. Prove correctness by [[Greedy Algorithm#Proof of Correctness|these strategies]]

## Event Scheduling

Q. **Interval Scheduling** ([[Greedy Algorithm]])
- [[Dynamic Programming]] idea works
	- `dp[i] = max(dp[]+1`
	- $O(n^3)$ time
- [[Greedy Algorithm]] is even better
	- Idea: sort by

alg. Interval Scheduling with $n$ rooms

Q. Multiple Room Interval Scheduling

Q. Interval Coloring

Q. Interval Cover Problem

## Job Scheduling

Q. **Minimize Makespan** (=maximum time on any machine) of $n$ machines
![[Scheduling Problem-20231203164147354.png|310]]
- NP-Hard problem (reduce from $\frac{1}{2}$-[[Subset Sum]])

alg. **Approximate Greedy Makespan**: Always choose the least loaded machine
- Is a 2-level approximation ![[Scheduling Problem-20231203170054815.png]]
alg. **Better Approximate Greedy Makespan**: Assign from longest to shortest job, to least loaded machine every time.

alg. **Minimize lateness of jobs**

- Interval Scheduling
	- schedule $n$ jobs
		- no dependencies
	- => how many jobs can you complete? (total time doesn't matter!)
	- conflict when:
		- Start[i] <
	- [[Dynamic Programming]] solution is easy
		1. OPT = max(1+OPT(jobs that don't conflict with job 1) vs OPT(2..n))
	- => but $O(n^3)$ or even with improvement $O(n^2)$!
- Greedy solution:
	- job that finishes first = job that leaves the most amount of remaining time
	- implementation
		1. Sort by finish time
		2. choose earlyest finish time
		3. choose next earliest finish time that doesn't conflict with most recently finished job
		4. Done!
	- => $O(n\log n)$ time (because sorting)!
	- Proof by induction: Exchange Argument
		- base: $Y*$ optimal solution has $y_{1} in Y^*$
			- if you have $x_{1}$ that finish time earlier than $y_{1}$â€¦
			- removing $y_{1}$ and adding $x_{1}$ is also optimal solution
- Try: dp solution
- variation: make span algorithm (greedy is close to optimal, but not optimal)

- interval scheduling, but with $n$ meeting rooms
	- greedy still words!
- minimum total completion time.
- minimize lateness
	- sort by ascending lateness<<
