And I think regardless of who is in what job those values are so embedded in this company that Apple will do extremely well.

> [!summary]
Apple's focus is on **consumer experience** above all else.

## Principles

### Focus
- Apple makes few products, but makes them really well
	- Make only a few ads, but make them really well.
- [[Get Lost in the Weeds|Attention to Detail]]. Color-matching cables and stickers, black PCB, specific squircle curvature to maximize visual appeal.

### Control
- Vertical integration: control key technologies
	- [The Grand Theory of Apple - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO0b-l-u7Yk)
	  Apple is a technology company, only incidentally. Technology is a [[Ends Disregards the Means|means to an end]]—delivering great experiences.
### Excellence
- Ship when the product is ready.
	- Arriving late to a market is okay, if the product delivers a convincing experience.

## Design

> If you never change anything, what you can engineer is really just incremental. But **when you're willing to change things, you open up a whole new world of design.**

> There are many design innovations \[…] that users won't actually see, but they'll **certainly experience.**

> Air is pulled into vents \[…] by fans with asymmetrically positioned fan blades. \[…] We position ours asymmetrically to spread the sound over a variety of frequencies **which makes it seem quieter and less intrusive.**

> Simplicity is so much more than the absence of clutter and ornamentation. It's about **bringing order to complexity.**

> Design is more than how something looks. It's how something feels and works, on so many different levels.

Apple often quotes [[Alan Kay]]:

> People who are serious about their hardware, should design their own software.

## Marketing

**Why Keynotes?** Apple wants to fully [[Control]] the [[first impression]] of the device, and thereby implant a strong, purposefully constructed image in the press and ultimately the consumer's mind.

**Why Ads?** Apple's TV ads are (for most people) the first impression of the product. It's the one opportunity to control the messaging.

- Subtle sound effects of water while showing the river, the whoosh of the school bus or the crowded chatter of the coffee shop make the scene interactive and focused.
- Essentially, it's message is: "wouldn't you want to be that person?"
	- Apple marketing adheres to this messaging a lot. Phil Schiller said after unveiling the new (trash can) Mac Pro, showing a slide with a guy with three 4K displays: "you can be this guy."

[iPhone 8 (PRODUCT)RED™ Special Edition - Commercial - YouTube](https://youtu.be/V95pPeDX2Zw)

- How can a phone be _sexy?_
- The music & visuals match to produce a emphatic and **resonant** atmosphere

[iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro - Reveal - YouTube](https://youtu.be/aj-h-jxK7Bs)

- Same as the iPhone 8 commercial above. It brings character to the phones; the iPhone 11 is playful, alive, and tactile, while the Pro is austere, practical, and precise.

[iPhone X - Announcement Video - YouTube](https://youtu.be/Y8Vf-rurOEI)

- It interacts between the phone's display showing a colorful wallpaper and the person's face lit up by a similar gradient of colors.
	- Message: this phone blurs the boundaries between [[Design as Human Interface|human and device]].
	- The message is supplemented by the primary feature that assists this coalescene: Face ID
		- Phil Schiller, in the Keynote, says specifically that the phone "recognizes you."
