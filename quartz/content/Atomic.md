Atomicity means indivisibility. Useful in a variety of contexts:

- **Programming & Concurrency.** atomic operations cannot have any operation happen between it during the operation i.e. it cannot be paused until completion
- [[(Article) Evergreen notes]] should be atomic for better, densely connected notes.
