## Why?

### Lack of Scientific Rigour in Economics

Economics doesn’t have **predicting power** (the test of correctness for scientific theories)…

- couldn’t predict recessions
- doesn’t pursue _distributive justice_
- better for designing economics/social institutions, maintaining social order, or _incentivizing individuals_ in society

This is because in economics the **strategy** of people are not considered:

> [!info] Economics assumes there are indefinitely many players in a market, thus the player’s influence on each other are negligible; i.e. they are **parametric agents.**
> → In reality, individuals act based on how they think others may act; i.e. they are **strategic agents.**

→ Conventional economic theory is useless as a predictor—it’ll only satisfy one’s curiosity

→ The correct/better theory for modeling economics is **[[Economics/MicroEconomics/Game Theory]]**—the theory of strategic interactions
