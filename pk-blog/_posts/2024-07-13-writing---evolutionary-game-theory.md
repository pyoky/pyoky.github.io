Our society relies on trust, more than it seems at a glance—but despite how trust in others is essential to human daily function, utilitarians and (to a limited extent) classical economists don't have a commonplace framework to understand how we ended up trusting one another so much. When everybody is a rational, utility-maximizing agent, every instance of trust-involving interaction is in essence a prisoner's dilemma (PD), where you may benefit from exploiting your opponent—considering this, anarchy is the Nash equilibrium solution, and humanity will live life solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short. But civilization flourishes—how?

A combination of evolution and game theory explains the emergence of these high-trust, cooperative societies. I claim that:
1. The Ultra Complex System of culture is designed by evolution
2. Human brains, also through coinciding evolution within culture, accepts the social constructs that meshes with the cultural.
3. A Prestige Economy is essential to culture as a distributed solution to PD
4. A Trust Escrow System is essential to culture as a centralized solution to PD

# I. Evolution of Ultra Complex Systems

It is evolution in the sense that these structures—that I call Ultra Complex Systems (UCS), adopted from [design theory](https://pyoky.me/notes/(Article)-Design-Beyond-Human-Abilities)—are not created through intelligent design but through a random search of all possible instantiations of culture. It is natural selection because, while variations and mutations of culture emerged within prehistoric humanity, only ones with effective solutions to the problem of PD remains. This is the background in which I argue these concepts, and thus is not a value judgement on any specific culture, but an observation of cross-cultural commonalities of collective human behavior. 

Together with this, our biological brains evolved within this cultural context in emotion and behavior that is compatible with its cultural context. Evolution is both in biology, exemplified by the necessity of language, and culturally adopted self-perception.[^footnote]

Society and self simultaneously evolve, selecting for bigger and complex societies. By limitation of the speed of biological change and complexity of social interaction the speed of this evolution is slow, and we are still barely at the forefront of this evolution. When technology connected the modern world, this is one of the reasons we don’t consider each other so foreign to be different from us, unlike our ancestors who actually lived with different hominid species.[^human-tragedy]

# II. What We Know that We Don't Know

CGP Grey in Hello Internet coins the concept of the necessary lies of civilization (NLC). These are concepts that may not reflect the reality of human interaction, but are necessary for civilization to function. He gives a few examples: 
 - Violence is not the solution
 - Hard work pays off
 - Money isn’t the solution
These are insidious in that we don't notice their residence in the brain, and our behavior reflects them without our knowledge. Gary Bernard, via Benno Rice in his talk The Terrifying Longevity of Ideas, suggests that this is called *ideology*. This is within the usual framework of epistemic metacognition:
1. What we know that we know: Knowledge
2. What we know that we don't know:
3. What we don't know that we don't know
4. What we don't know that we know: Ideology

Ideologies are harder to specify than NLCs. While NLCs are the atomic ideas, ideologies are the structures of such ideas. Heterosexuality is an ideology because we predominantly presume that sexual attraction is directed towards the opposite sex, and gender is determined by birth. Capitalism is an ideology because we take for granted the price mechanism, interest is accumulated on capital, and labor is sold at market value (or exchange value). These are products of education or social reproduction, and thus we are, with effort, able to take off such lenses, and indeed it is often virtuous to do so.

However, ideologies are powerful not simply because we are educated within them, but also because our brains are designed ready for ideological binding. Heterosexuality _is_ loosely familiar with what we see in most animals and _most_ people are heterosexual; capitalism _is_ familiar as we intuit the uses and value of money from a young age, without explicit understanding of the price mechanism. These two examples I give are chosen because they each represent a macro- and micro-level solution to PD, and that our minds are susceptible to them. They evolved in culture precisely because we are suspiciously vulnerable to their grasp, and their roots lie deep in human nature.

# III. The Prestige Economy

Prestige or social status is the object given to the subject which performs acts beneficial to a social group. [Melting Asphalt](https://meltingasphalt.com/social-status-down-the-rabbit-hole/) outlines the concept effectively, but I will briefly develop it separately here. Prestige is desired by all within a group in the same prestige economy, because its holder has access to resources available to others—influence, respect, sexual access, opportunities. Those with less prestige _celebrates_ those with more, and thus encourages behavior beneficial to the group. A hero saves the day, and others throw a party in his honor.

I describe prestige as an economy because it is similar to how we perceive the monetary economy, though with much diverse currencies and insular group economies. *Not all* can have prestige, because it is meaningful only relative to one another; thus the prestige economy is an approximate zero-sum game. It is a *currency*, because you can exchange it for material and emotional goods (goods outside the prestige currency) by *requesting* those with less prestige to give them up voluntarily, or with other prestige currencies (circulation within the prestige currencies).[^foucault]

Groups ranging from friend groups to state apparatuses accept different prestige currencies, from volunteering to shopping groceries, to awarding patriotic actors ("above and beyond the call of duty") or constructed statues of historical heroes. Certain prestige currencies hold value only in certain groups (singing abilities in an a cappella group) while others are near-universal (anonymous donation to habitat for humanity). The performance of awarding and celebrating prestigious individuals simultaneously reproduces itself, as others observe and internalize such actions. We do this subconsciously, and especially during childhood; our value system is conditioned by how prestige is manifested and presented to us during youth.

# IV. Trust Escrow System

Prestige, however, cannot be the sole arbiter of cooperative motivation in society. It is inefficient because one must individually maintain a prestige calculus, and unstable because prestige may rapidly exchange hands, requiring a reorganization of the status hierarchy (i.e. interpersonal drama).

An escrow system is a financial entity used in transaction by distrusting parties. If the escrow is trusted by both, it may hold funds until conditions of a contract are met, and only then makes payment. The greatest hypothetical escrow system is a leviathan or social planner assigning resources and duties, to individuals without liberty. It is the Sybil system in Psycho-pass, and the Nozickian contract-enforcing government. Often real and fictional escrow systems are purposefully designed and implemented, like the U.S. government for banks. However within the prestige economy the guarantor of trust is a product of natural evolution.

Trust Escrow Systems (TSTs) are cultural norms, the atomic units of trust we hold others to. When we greet strangers, share food, or lend tools, we utilize TSTs. We may not trust others, but we trust that behaving in accordance to cultural norms will result in harmonious social interaction. When a person enters a culture (i.e. is socialized) they are educated the existing TSTs and learns to use it naturally. It is also a public good, non-excludable and non-rivalrus, and difficult to incentivize the cultural citizens to socialize into it; but once socialized, one benefits.

The invocation frequency of common cultural norms therefore is extremely indicative of a society’s general degree of trust. Homogeneous societies like Japan or Nordic countries, generally regarded as high-trust societies, have strongly shared TSTs or cultural norms that greases social interaction as well as business transaction: tea is served to guests, public transportation is assumed and reliable. The cost, through, is in diversity; a single, monolithic culture is imposed upon anybody socialized into it, via birth or immigration. Deviation is not only shameful but also immoral, chastised and excised. The collective good outweighs individual opinion.

On the other hand, TSTs break down when people from different cultures interact. Misunderstandings on social cues or figures of speech fester and without thorough explanation they cause a breakdown of social trust. U.S. pays for its cultural diversity in inefficiencies through the breakdown of cooperation in everyday life: single-family home prices as opposed to apartment complexes, personal vehicles instead of public transportation. However TSTs exist still in such cultures, though to a lesser extent: extroversion and smalltalk, omnipresent and homogeneous brand names and services, or car-based infrastructure, and to an extreme use of English throughout an unnaturally vast region. These are lesser TSTs, but without them the U.S. would still fail to function.

Assigning monetary cost to TSTs indicate they are indeed a figment of the prestige economy: the loss of utility from failure to cooperate in PD. TSTs form the foundation of any social group, easing interaction between people; it is a form of collective knowledge that reduces inefficiencies when interacting frequently with the same group of people, from family to country.

[^footnote]: Julian Jaynes’ explanation of the evolution of consciousness is an example of a similar argument. He suggests that the notion of the self residing in cranial space and inside the body is a social construction, and contributed to the evolution of consciousness.

[^moral-progress]: [Moral progress and political change “irks” us](https://aeon.co/essays/why-does-moral-progress-feel-preachy-and-annoying) because of this—we’re literally going against evolution. We overcome this by re-training our emotions to align with new social norms.

[^human-tragedy]: despite tragedies of colonialism and slavery, humanity is gradually in progress of overcoming them through an acknowledgement of a shared human race. This possibility of shared empathy, of an awareness of our [Species-being](https://pyoky.me/notes/Species-being) that explains this possibility, and us not devolving into further entrenched camps of tribalism.

[^foucault]: This conception of prestige is compatible with Michael Foucault's [Microphysics of Power](https://pyoky.me/notes/Microphysics-of-Power) , reframing it in game theory vernacular. Foucalt suggests power is not merely a dominance hierarchy but a universal field of social interaction. While Foucault is skeptical of power, the *emergence of prestige* model conceives power as a step in the direction of civilization; It is from brutal nature that prestige emerged and solved the cooperation problem of PD, but as humans we fetishize it to the extent it produces ideologies that reproduce without quintessence.
