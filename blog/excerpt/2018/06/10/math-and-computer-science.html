    <p><em>This was part of an essay for a summer college course in Number Theory and Cryptography.</em></p>

<p>The discipline of mathematics, I believe, is what describes the very nature of who we are — inevitably, though, as the world itself, in my understanding, may be just a complex execution of a mathematical program. Zooming out, however, cryptography and number theory, but more so mathematics in general, are both subjects of my greatest passion, in their practical application, but more so in their elegance and meaning.</p>

<p>When I was an elementary school student in Korea, I was recommended a book called “The Mathematics Shop,” which told the stories of Pythagoras’s theorem, Euclidian geometry, or <em>Gauss’s Seven Bridges of Königsberg</em> with pictures and stories. For me, the book contained, more than anything, stories that told me how our world is designed—maths is a story playing in the theatre that is our world, our universe. It engraved, in my young mind, a principle that I would later discover to be the base of my personality: that our universe is fundamentally a mathematical one.</p>

<hr />

<p>A very personal but quite common first encounter with number theory, for me, was with Goldbach’s conjecture. Another mathematics book recommended to me by my middle school Korean math teacher told a fictional story about a mathematician attempting, though failing, to prove the conjecture. For a Korean 7th-grade student, math was something to despise and hate, as a subject that brings down your grades. This book broke this overshadowing perception that mathematics is a problem-solving subject—that practicing mathematics is much different from learning it, and more importantly, that it is a <em>human</em> subject, requiring creativity as much as insight.</p>

<p>Naturally, I researched for more information on these fields, but soon realized that without formal education my understanding was limited. I asked my teachers for recommendations, who pointed me to summer courses at nearby schools, in which I took courses in basic discrete mathematics, number theory, and combinatorics. The foundations of these subjects help me through my current courses, but more importantly, helped me realize early on what I was “missing out on.” There were whole worlds of mathematics that were to be explored, that I have never seen before. This was when I saw how deep this field can go, and how naïve I was.</p>

<hr />

<p>On the other hand, through its connection with my interest in computer science, I discovered how interesting the field of cryptography can be, on a mathematical level. My math research project assessment in my first year of IB, was a chance to show my interests in these fields, and I chose my topic in cryptography: a mathematical analysis of an encryption device, the Enigma machine. In the abstract of the research paper in which I discussed the encryption mechanisms of the device as well as how it was broken, I expressed the reason for my choice of topic, that I would like to <a href="/blog/2017/12/01/thoughts-on-encryption.html">share</a>.</p>

<p>I am now pursuing mathematics in my IB Mathematics Higher Level course, while also preparing for AP Calculus exam in May. The knowledge I gain from these courses, however, as I see now, are merely tools in practicing mathematics. I am now only halfway—or even less—done climbing to the figurative shoulders of giants; what I might me able to witness at the top of them, how much more of the world I can make sense, is what excites me to try every new opportunity to learn math.</p>
