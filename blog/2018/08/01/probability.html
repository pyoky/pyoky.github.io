    <p>A major shift in my perspective of how I should lead life began with considering the following prayer, by Reinhold Niebuhr (1892-1971):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>God grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change; 
courage to change the things I can; 
and wisdom to know the difference.
(…)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am often blinded by a false, but tempting notion that there is a way of doing that is better;  that there is always another path that will reward a better life. This idea was rooted in me by a quote from Rob Siltanen, renowned for its adoption in Apple’s “Think Different” ad campaign:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They’re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can’t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both, at a glance equally meaningful quotes, and do seem to hold some truths. But neither can coexist, they are mutually exclusive mindsets—to accept the status quo, or to reject it. Yet either are both tempting.</p>

<p>In one of my Theory of Knowledge classes, we were offered some situations and were to predict using inductive logic—e.g. the likelihood of a stock price to rise or fall, either without context, or given that it has been rising steadily the last 10 years. Smugly, I proceeded to reject all evidence and only stick to what is knowable, answering that neither is more likely in all contexts. I was surprised to find that I was wrong.</p>

<p>There is a limit to understanding a perspective, and a limit to what is feasibly knowable. There is no ideal perfect information in markets, or the ability to foretell the existence of black swans before it is discovered.</p>

<p>Those who shout life is unfair, or that it ultimately is, do not consider the intrinsic randomness that life offers to everyone. There is cause and effect and to an extent predictability, but those processes are so minuscule and microscopic that it is infeasible to try to understand. Balancing this unfairness, luck, and unpredictability, the simplest way to sum this up is to consider life as a sequence of probabilistic events.</p>

<p>Given that there are too many unpredictable variables, the only choice is to stick to the things we know. We look at what we have, make estimates, and choose the path that is most likely to lead to our desired future. All we can do is to increase the number of variables we have, and learn how to interpret them more correctly.</p>

<p>In this case, if life is led by probability, not certainty or emotion, it is necessary to look after and console ourselves, and hope that our minds have the emotional strength to cope with our choices, and to take responsibility, may the result be favorable or not, the serenity, to accept the things I cannot change; courage, to change the things I can; and wisdom, to know the difference.</p>
