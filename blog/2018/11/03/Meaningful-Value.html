    <p>What does it mean for something to be meaningful? We rarely stop and ponder what it truly means; <em>getting into this college is meaningful to me</em>—but <em>why</em>? <em>Maintaining this relationship is meaningful to us</em>—but <em>why</em>? Dismissing “<em>meaning”</em> as some inferior, emotional concept is simple enough, but doesn’t provide any practical advice. And still, since we are, regrettably, humans with monkey brains, emotions exists and is inevitable.</p>

<p>A few moments of consideration leads to the unavoidable question: Why does anything matter if we are going to die anyways? Everything we hold value to will meet an end—from the point of your death, nothing would matter anymore. (Note, though, that this is equally true when death is eliminated; if we live forever, why would doing anything matter? We have (literally) all the time in the world.)</p>

<p>I formed a personal attachment to the concept because I found “happiness” an unsatisfactory answer to the question: <em>what is the meaning of life?</em> Emotions like joy and happiness are easily manipulated and tricked, ultimately unstable, and therefore should not form a basis for questions as important as the purpose of conscious life. Regressing to a higher level and asking back: “What is <em>meaning</em> anyways?”, was my solution.</p>

<p>Naturally, defining <em>meaning</em> as “extracting positive emotions,” would be circular, which quickly eliminates any arguments regarding the <em>biological</em> purpose of life. Referencing a dictionary: <em>“important or worthwhile quality; purpose: this can lead to new meaning in the life of older people,”</em> we can redefine <em>meaningfulness</em> as <em>value</em>. The <em>value</em> of life; the <em>value</em> of love—the only difference being that <em>meaning</em> has a more personal nuance.</p>

<p>Value, though, is different from <em>goal</em>. Value includes the process—the effort and work, the tools and techniques—to achieve a <em>goal</em>. In a sense, the <em>goal</em> is what the outside world sees. Value, though, is personal. The goal in an exam is to get a good score, but the value, could be something like “testing one’s understanding.”</p>

<p>Value, though, is equally vague in its origins, and faces the same problem with rational reasons: <em>why is anything valuable if we die</em>; and emotional approaches: <em>recreational drugs make you happy—so are they valuable?</em> What we want might be a mixture of emotional and rationality—something that links those two together, but not in a way where logic maps, or <em>manipulates</em> emotion, rather where <em>emotion</em> governs our reasoning.</p>

<p>This is quite natural for us. We develop tools and techniques to be more productive, to reduce our workload, to be less tired. We use our skills, or <em>reasoning capabilities,</em> in order to make money, to buy things that make us happy. Or maybe making money naturally brings you happiness. In any case, value is derived from reasoning, but ultimately concludes with emotion.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s simply our desire to hide from the outside world the fact that we are, ultimately, emotional creatures. Feelings cannot be clearly communicated—but rational reasons can. While the world does not consider your own feelings, you and your family, friends, might. But you cannot simply go into a job interview and proudly declare “I applied just to make money,” and you equally cannot say “My sole reason for this relationship is to maximize personal happiness.” <em>Meaning</em> and <em>value</em> would, then, ultimately be a conflict between the outside world and our inner minds—the clash between <em>reason</em> and <em>emotion,</em> the discrepancy between what we think and what we feel, wrapped up in one simple and convenient word. It isn’t something to be embarrassed about to say out loud, but it certainly is a thought-provoking concept.</p>
