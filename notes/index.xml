    <description>Agents § We’re doing static analysis; i.e. it’s very LR or very SR. Numerous agents of each sector are grouped into a representative agent. Representative household Objective: maximize utility over consumption (C) and Leisure (L) within the utility function → Labor Supply SN and # of laborers N → Goods Demanded D Representative Firm Objective: maximuze profit (π) over capital (K) and Labor (N) within the production function → Labor Demand DN → Goods Supplied S Government Role: collect taxes and pay transfers (NT); spend remaining on the goods market G Household Optimization § For households the price of consumption goods and the price of leisure [=wage] is an exogenous variable; i.</description>
